        "abstract": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, UCL, London, United Kingdom Microsoft Research, Cambridge ABSTRACT Scientific discovery hinges on the effective integration of metadata, which refers to a set of conceptual operations such as determining what information is relevant for inquiry, and data, which encompasses physical operations such as observation and experimentation. This paper introduces the Causal Modelling Agent (CMA), a novel framework that synergizes the metadata-based reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the data-driven modelling of Deep Structural Causal Models (DSCMs) for the task of causal discovery. We evaluate the CMA\u2019s performance on a number of benchmarks, as well as on the real-world task of modelling the clinical and radiological phenotype of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD). Our experimental results indicate that the CMA can outperform previous purely data-driven or metadata-driven approaches to causal discovery. In our real-world application, we use the CMA to derive new insights into the causal relationships among biomarkers of AD.",

        "peer_review_with_watermark": "Alamet Review:\n\nSummary of the Paper:\nThis paper introduces the Causal Modelling Agent (CMA), a new framework that merges Large Language Models (LLMs) with Deep Structural Causal Models (DSCMs) to facilitate causal discovery in multi-modal datasets. By fusing the reasoning abilities of LLMs with the data-driven modeling approach of DSCMs, the CMA seeks to identify causal connections between various variables.\n\nStrengths:\n1. The CMA framework presents a novel and potentially effective method for discovering causality within multi-modal data.\n2. The integration of LLM techniques with DSCMs creates a synergistic effect that capitalizes on the respective strengths of both approaches, enhancing causal discovery.\n3. Evidence is provided that the framework surpasses current data-driven and metadata-driven methods across several benchmarks.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. The paper presupposes a significant level of knowledge regarding both LLMs and DSCMs, which may pose challenges for readers who lack expertise in these areas to fully grasp the contributions and difficulties outlined.\n2. The experimental design might not completely tackle the issues associated with multi-modal data, where variables could display varying distributions or correlations across different modalities.\n3. Additional evaluations on datasets characterized by more intricate structures or greater dimensionality would likely benefit the research.\n\nSuggestions for Enhancements:\n1. A deeper literature review on causal discovery in multi-modal data could provide a more enriching context for the contributions mentioned in the paper.\n2. Including further experimental evaluations using datasets with varied structural complexities and dimensionality would yield a more thorough evaluation of the CMA framework.\n3. Offering a more exhaustive analysis of the challenges posed by multi-modal data and how the CMA framework addresses these would improve the overall quality of the study.\n\nRecommendation:\nIn light of the contributions made, I suggest accepting the paper for publication in its current iteration. Nonetheless, I would appreciate seeing additional experimental evaluations on diverse datasets to achieve a more thorough assessment of the CMA framework.\n\nReviewer:\n[Your Name]",

        "abstract": "Our understanding of the visual world is centered around various concept axes, characterizing different aspects of visual entities. While different concept axes can be easily specified by language, e.g., color, the exact visual nuances along each axis often exceed the limitations of linguistic articulations, e.g., a particular style of painting. In this work, our goal is to learn a language-informed visual concept representation, by simply distilling large pre-trained vision-language models. Specifically, we train a set of concept encoders to encode the information pertinent to a set of language-informed concept axes, with an objective of reproducing the input image through a pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) model. To encourage better disentanglement of different concept encoders, we anchor the concept embeddings to a set of text embeddings obtained from a pre-trained Visual Question Answering (VQA) model. At inference time, the model extracts concept embeddings along various axes from new test images, which can be remixed to generate images with novel compositions of visual concepts. With a lightweight test-time finetuning procedure, it can also generalize to novel concepts unseen at training. Project page at https://cs.stanford.edu/ \u0303yzzhang/projects/concept-axes.",

We consider motion as an important cue for identifying parts, that all particles on the same part share the common motion pattern. From the perspective of fluid simulation, existing deformation-based methods for dynamic NeRF can be seen as parameterizing the scene motion under the Eulerian view, i.e., focusing on specific locations in space through which the fluid flows as time passes. However, it is intractable to extract the motion of constituting objects or parts using the Eulerian view representation. In this work, we introduce the dual Lagrangian view and enforce representations under the Eulerian/Lagrangian views to be cycle-consistent. Under the Lagrangian view, we parameterize the scene motion by tracking the trajectory of particles on objects. The Lagrangian view makes it convenient to discover parts by factorizing the scene motion as a composition of part-level rigid motions. Experimentally, our method can achieve fast and high-quality dynamic scene reconstruction from even a single moving camera, and the induced part-based representation allows direct applications of part tracking, animation, 3D scene editing, etc.",

        "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL), which aims to fully explore offline datasets for training without interaction with environments, has attracted growing recent attention. A major challenge for the real-world application of offline RL stems from the robustness against state observation perturbations, e.g., as a result of sensor errors or adversarial attacks. Unlike online robust RL, agents cannot be adversarially trained in the offline setting. In this work, we propose Diffusion Model-Based Predictor (DMBP) in a new framework that recovers the actual states with conditional diffusion models for state-based RL tasks. To mitigate the error accumulation issue in model-based estimation resulting from the classical training of conventional diffusion models, we propose a non-Markovian training objective to minimize the sum entropy of denoised states in RL trajectory. Experiments on standard benchmark problems demonstrate that DMBP can significantly enhance the robustness of existing offline RL algorithms against different scales of random noises and adversarial attacks on state observations. Further, the proposed framework can effectively deal with incomplete state observations with random combinations of multiple unobserved dimensions in the test.

Though existing approaches in protein design have thoroughly explored structure-to-sequence dependencies in proteins, RNA design still confronts difficulties due to structural complexity and data scarcity. Moreover, direct transplantation of protein design methodologies into RNA design fails to achieve satisfactory outcomes although sharing similar structural components. In this study, we aim to systematically construct a data-driven RNA design pipeline.

By constraining data representations within a limited hyperspherical space, the intrinsic relationships between data points could be explicitly imposed. Moreover, we incorporated extracted secondary structures with base pairs as prior knowledge to facilitate the RNA design process.

        "abstract": "Visual reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in continuous control tasks. Despite its progress, current algorithms are still unsatisfactory in virtually every aspect of the performance such as sample efficiency, asymptotic performance, and their robustness to the choice of random seeds. In this paper, we identify a major shortcoming in existing visual RL methods that is the agents often exhibit sustained inactivity during early training, thereby limiting their ability to explore effectively. Expanding upon this crucial observation, we additionally unveil a significant correlation between the agents\u2019 inclination towards motorically inactive exploration and the absence of neuronal activity within their policy networks. To quantify this inactivity, we adopt dormant ratio (Sokar et al., 2023) as a metric to measure inactivity in the RL agent\u2019s network. Empirically, we also recognize that the dormant ratio can act as a standalone indicator of an agent\u2019s activity level, regardless of the received reward signals. Leveraging the aforementioned insights, we introduce DrM , a method that uses three core mechanisms to guide agents\u2019 exploration-exploitation trade-offs by actively minimizing the dormant ratio. Experiments demonstrate that DrM achieves significant improvements in sample efficiency and asymptotic performance with no broken seeds (76 seeds in total) across three continuous control benchmark environments, including DeepMind Control Suite, MetaWorld, and Adroit. Most importantly, DrM is the first model-free algorithm that consistently solves tasks in both the Dog and Manipulator domains from the DeepMind Control Suite as well as three dexterous hand manipulation tasks without demonstrations in Adroit, all based on pixel observations. 1 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Training Progress 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 Ep iso de R ew ar d Deepmind Control Suite (8 Hard Tasks) 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Training Progress 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Su cc es s R at e MetaWorld (8 Tasks) 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Training Progress 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Su cc es s R at e Adroit (3 Tasks) DrM DrQ-v2 ALIX TACO Figure 1: Success rate and episode reward as a function of training progress for each of the three domains that we consider (Deepmind Control Suite, MetaWorld, Adroit).

        "abstract": "Learning neural subset selection tasks, such as compound selection in AI-aided drug discovery, have become increasingly pivotal across diverse applications. The existing methodologies in the field primarily concentrate on constructing models that capture the relationship between utility function values and subsets within their respective supersets. However, these approaches tend to overlook the valuable information contained within the superset when utilizing neural networks to model set functions. In this work, we address this oversight by adopting a probabilistic perspective. Our theoretical findings demonstrate that when the target value is conditioned on both the input set and subset, it is essential to incorporate an invariant sufficient statistic of the superset into the subset of interest for effective learning. This ensures that the output value remains invariant to permutations of the subset and its corresponding superset, enabling identification of the specific superset from which the subset originated. Motivated by these insights, we propose a simple yet effective information aggregation module designed to merge the representations of subsets and supersets from a permutation invariance perspective. Comprehensive empirical evaluations across diverse tasks and datasets validate the enhanced efficacy of our approach over conventional methods, underscoring the practicality and potency of our proposed strategies in real-world contexts.",

The authors highlight that current methodologies tend to concentrate on building models that delineate the connection between utility function values and subsets in their corresponding supersets, largely neglecting the significant information held within the superset itself. By taking a probabilistic approach, the proposed framework remedies this gap through an information aggregation module aimed at combining the representations of subsets and supersets with regards to permutation invariance. The authors assess the framework's performance across various tasks such as product recommendation, set anomaly detection, and compound selection in AI-supported drug discovery. Findings indicate that the proposed framework surpasses leading methods in accuracy and efficiency.\n\n**Strengths**\n\n1.  The introduction of a groundbreaking framework for neural subset selection that incorporates permutation invariance.\n2.  A comprehensive theoretical examination of the framework, including the innovative concept of invariant sufficient representation.\n3.  Evaluation of the framework across multiple tasks such as product recommendation, anomaly detection in sets, and compound selection in AI-assisted drug discovery.\n4.  Performance results indicate that the framework outshines state-of-the-art methods regarding both accuracy and efficiency.\n\n**Weaknesses**\n\n1.  Some sections of the paper may be excessively technical, potentially hindering comprehension for those without specialized knowledge.\n2.  There is a possibility that the authors place too much emphasis on theoretical aspects, making practical applications less approachable.\n3.  The assessment of the compound selection task may not be as pertinent to the overall impact of the framework.\n4.  The paper could benefit from a more defined roadmap for possible future research.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement**\n\n1.  The authors should contemplate enriching the literature review to furnish a deeper understanding of the framework's context and significance.\n2.  Making the implementation process clearer and more straightforward would enhance accessibility for practical applications.\n3.  A broader range of evaluation tasks may provide a more nuanced understanding of the framework\u2019s overall impact, especially concerning the compound selection task.\n4.  Including a clearer outline of future research directions would be advantageous for guiding subsequent studies.\n\n**Recommendation**\n\nThis paper presents a compelling framework for neural subset selection that integrates permutation invariance. With a thorough theoretical analysis of the framework and evaluations across several tasks, the authors demonstrate that their approach outperforms leading methodologies in accuracy and efficiency. Given the framework's prospective implications in the realm of AI-assisted drug discovery and set-based processes, it stands as a timely and relevant contribution.

        "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are attracting growing interest for their energyefficient computing when implemented on neuromorphic hardware. However, directly training SNNs, even adopting batch normalization (BN), is highly challenging due to their non-differentiable activation function and the temporally delayed accumulation of outputs over time. For SNN training, this temporal accumulation gives rise to Temporal Covariate Shifts (TCS) along the temporal dimension, a phenomenon that would become increasingly pronounced with layer-wise computations across multiple layers and multiple time-steps. In this paper, we introduce TAB (Temporal Accumulated Batch Normalization), a novel SNN batch normalization method that addresses the temporal covariate shift issue by aligning with neuron dynamics (specifically the accumulated membrane potential) and utilizing temporal accumulated statistics for data normalization. Within its framework, TAB effectively encapsulates the historical temporal dependencies that underlie the membrane potential accumulation process, thereby establishing a natural connection between neuron dynamics and TAB batch normalization.

SNNs encounter considerable difficulties in training due to their non-differentiable activation functions and the delayed accumulation of outputs over time. The TAB approach resolves this issue by leveraging temporal accumulated pre-synaptic inputs and utilizing accumulated batch statistics (\u00b51:t, \u03c321:t) to normalize the data.\n\nAdvantages:\n\n1.

Missing Comparisons with Other Methods: It would enhance the study to examine how TAB performs in relation to other batch normalization techniques tailored for SNNs.\n\nImprovement Recommendations:\n\n1. Thorough Comparison with Alternative Normalization Techniques: Conducting performance comparisons of TAB against other normalization methods aimed at SNNs would be advantageous.\n\n2. Investigating Overfitting Concerns: It is advisable to investigate and analyze the risk of overfitting associated with the use of accumulated batch statistics (\u00b51:t, \u03c321:t) and explore strategies to reduce this risk.\n\nConclusion:\n\n1.

        "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the rapid progress and broad application of diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs). Sampling from DPMs can be viewed as solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Despite the promising performance, the generation of DPMs usually consumes much time due to the large number of function evaluations (NFE). Though recent works have accelerated the sampling to around 20 steps with high-order solvers, the sample quality with less than 10 NFE can still be improved. In this paper, we propose a unified sampling framework (USF) to study the optional strategies for solver. Under this framework, we further reveal that taking different solving strategies at different timesteps may help further decrease the truncation error, and a carefully designed solver schedule has the potential to improve the sample quality by a large margin. Therefore, we propose a new sampling framework based on the exponential integral formulation that allows free choices of solver strategy at each step and design specific decisions for the framework. Moreover, we propose S, a predictor-based search method that automatically optimizes the solver schedule to get a better time-quality trade-off of sampling. We demonstrate that S can find outstanding solver schedules which outperform the state-of-the-art sampling methods on CIFAR-10, CelebA, ImageNet, and LSUN-Bedroom datasets. Specifically, we achieve 2.69 FID with 10 NFE and 6.86 FID with 5 NFE on CIFAR-10 dataset, outperforming the SOTA method significantly. We further apply S to Stable-Diffusion model and get an acceleration ratio of 2\u00d7, showing the feasibility of sampling in very few steps without retraining the neural network.",

        "abstract": "Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have gained significant popularity among researchers as a powerful tool for understanding unknown distributions based on limited samples. This popularity stems partly from their impressive performance and partly from their ability to provide meaningful feature representations in the latent space. Wasserstein Autoencoders (WAEs), a variant of VAEs, aim to not only improve model efficiency but also interpretability. However, there has been limited focus on analyzing their statistical guarantees. The matter is further complicated by the fact that the data distributions to which WAEs are applied such as natural images are often presumed to possess an underlying low-dimensional structure within a high-dimensional feature space, which current theory does not adequately account for, rendering known bounds inefficient. To bridge the gap between the theory and practice of WAEs, in this paper, we show that WAEs can learn the data distributions when the network architectures are properly chosen. We show that the convergence rates of the expected excess risk in the number of samples for WAEs are independent of the high feature dimension, instead relying only on the intrinsic dimension of the data distribution.",

The framework introduced by the authors clarifies the decomposition of errors into optimization error, generalization error, misspecification error, and regularization error. The established limits on excess risk reveal a balance between generalization and misspecification errors based on the sample size.\n\nA significant strength of this paper lies in the authors' employment of the upper Minkowski dimension of the target distribution's support, which effectively characterizes the data's intrinsic dimensionality. Additionally, the authors illustrate that the convergence rates of expected excess risk concerning sample size for WAEs are unaffected by the high feature dimension, aligning with the expected outcomes.\n\nAnother notable strength is the experimental investigation presented by the authors, which shows that the error rates in the WAE context are predominantly influenced by the data's intrinsic dimension. Their findings further indicate that error rates are lower for cases with two latent variables compared to those with sixteen.\n\nHowever, one weakness in this study is the potentially excessive assumptions made by the authors regarding the Lipschitz-smoothness of the true model and the smoothness of latent codes in the limit. Additionally, the applicability of the upper Minkowski dimension may be limited in certain scenarios.\n\nTo mitigate this concern, the authors might explore alternative approaches, such as employing the covering number or Kolmogorov complexity, to describe the intrinsic dimensionality of the data. They should also attempt to derive error bounds when the latent space's dimensionality exceeds that of the data\u2019s intrinsic dimension.\n\nRegarding the previous concern, it would be beneficial for the authors to derive error bounds in scenarios where the latent codes in the limit lack smoothness. They should also investigate deriving error bounds when these latent codes exhibit other forms of non-smoothness.\n\nTo enhance the paper's overall quality, it is recommended that the authors pursue deriving error bounds for instances where the latent space's dimension is larger than the intrinsic dimension of the data and also for cases where the latent codes are characterized by various types of non-smoothness.\n\nIn terms of addressing optimization error, the authors should strive to derive error bounds in contexts where optimization error is substantial. They should also examine cases where the optimization error presents different forms of non-convexity.\n\nLastly, a final suggestion is for the authors to look into deriving error bounds for situations in which the latent codes in the limit show other expressions of non-smoothness.\n\n$$\\label{Reviewer}\\$",

While conventional reward models (RMs) have exhibited remarkable scalability, they oft struggle with fundamental functionality such as arithmetic computation, code execution, and factual lookup. In this paper, we propose a tool-augmented preference modeling approach, named Themis, to address these limitations by empowering RMs with access to external environments, including calculators and search engines. This approach not only fosters synergy between tool utilization and reward grading but also enhances interpretive capacity and scoring reliability. Our study delves into the integration of external tools into RMs, enabling them to interact with diverse external sources and construct task-specific tool engagement and reasoning traces in an autoregressive manner. We validate our approach across a wide range of domains, incorporating seven distinct external tools. Our experimental results demonstrate a noteworthy overall improvement of 17.7% across eight tasks in preference ranking. Furthermore, our approach outperforms Gopher 280B by 7.3% on TruthfulQA task in zero-shot evaluation. In human evaluations, RLHF trained with Themis attains an average win rate of 32% when compared to baselines across four distinct tasks.

        "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) are adopted as a fundamental component of language technologies, it is crucial to accurately characterize their performance. Because choices in prompt design can strongly influence model behavior, this design process is critical in effectively using any modern pre-trained generative language model. In this work, we focus on LLM sensitivity to a quintessential class of meaning-preserving design choices: prompt formatting. We find that several widely used open-source LLMs are extremely sensitive to subtle changes in prompt formatting in few-shot settings, with performance differences of up to 76 accuracy points when evaluated using LLaMA-2-13B. Sensitivity remains even when increasing model size, the number of few-shot examples, or performing instruction tuning. Our analysis suggests that work evaluating LLMs with prompting-based methods would benefit from reporting a range of performance across plausible prompt formats, instead of the currently-standard practice of reporting performance on a single format. We also show that format performance only weakly correlates between models, which puts into question the methodological validity of comparing models with an arbitrarily chosen, fixed prompt format. To facilitate systematic analysis we propose FORMATSPREAD, an algorithm that rapidly evaluates a sampled set of plausible prompt formats for a given task, and reports the interval of expected performance without accessing model weights1. Furthermore, we present a suite of analyses that characterize the nature of this sensitivity, including exploring the influence of particular atomic perturbations and the internal representation of particular formats.",

        "abstract": "There has been a recent surge of interest in developing generally-capable agents that can adapt to new tasks without additional training in the environment. Learning world models from reward-free exploration is a promising approach, and enables policies to be trained using imagined experience for new tasks. However, achieving a general agent requires robustness across different environments. In this work, we address the novel problem of generating curricula in the reward-free setting to train robust world models. We consider robustness in terms of minimax regret over all environment instantiations and show that the minimax regret can be connected to minimising the maximum error in the world model across environment instances. This result informs our algorithm, WAKER: Weighted Acquisition of Knowledge across Environments for Robustness. WAKER selects environments for data collection based on the estimated error of the world model for each environment. Our experiments demonstrate that WAKER outperforms several baselines, resulting in improved robustness, efficiency, and generalisation.",

        "abstract": "In-context learning is a promising paradigm that utilizes in-context examples as prompts for the predictions of large language models. These prompts are crucial for achieving strong performance. However, since the prompts need to be sampled from a large volume of annotated examples, finding the right prompt may result in high annotation costs. To address this challenge, this paper introduces an influence-driven selective annotation method that aims to minimize annotation costs while improving the quality of in-context examples. The essence of our method is to select a pivotal subset from a large-scale unlabeled data pool to annotate for the subsequent sampling of prompts. Specifically, a directed graph is first constructed to represent unlabeled data. Afterward, the influence of candidate unlabeled subsets is quantified with a diffusion process. A simple yet effective greedy algorithm for unlabeled data selection is lastly introduced. It iteratively selects the data if it provides a maximum marginal gain with respect to quantified influence. Compared with previous efforts on selective annotations, our influencedriven method works in an end-to-end manner, avoids an intractable explicit balance between data diversity and representativeness, and enjoys theoretical support. Experiments confirm the superiority of the proposed method on various benchmarks, achieving better performance under lower time consumption during subset selection.

        "abstract": "Transformers have become the standard in state-of-the-art vision architectures, achieving impressive performance on both image-level and dense pixelwise tasks. However, training vision transformers for high-resolution pixelwise tasks has a prohibitive cost. Typical solutions boil down to hierarchical architectures, fast and approximate attention, or training on low-resolution crops. This latter solution does not constrain architectural choices, but it leads to a clear performance drop when testing at resolutions significantly higher than that used for training, thus requiring ad-hoc and slow post-processing schemes. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for efficient training and inference of high-resolution vision transformers: the key principle is to mask out most of the high-resolution inputs during training, keeping only N random windows. This allows the model to learn local interactions between tokens inside each window, and global interactions between tokens from different windows. As a result, the model can directly process the high-resolution input at test time without any special trick. We show that this strategy is effective when using relative positional embedding such as rotary embeddings. It is 4 times faster to train than a full-resolution network, and it is straightforward to use at test time compared to existing approaches. We apply this strategy to two dense prediction tasks with high resolution data. First, we show on the task of semantic segmentation that a simple setting with 2 windows performs best, hence the name of our method: Win-Win. To demonstrate the generality of our contribution, we further extend it to the binocular task of optical flow, reaching state-of-the-art performance on the Spring benchmark that contains Full-HD images with an inference time an order of magnitude faster than the best competitor. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Training time (hours) 45 50 55 60 m ea n Io U Semantic segmentation on BDD100k Win-Win (31GB) Full-res.

        "abstract": "Existing losses used in deep metric learning (DML) for image retrieval often lead to highly non-uniform intra-class and inter-class representation structures across test classes and data distributions. When combined with the common practice of using a fixed threshold to declare a match, this gives rise to significant performance variations in terms of false accept rate (FAR) and false reject rate (FRR) across test classes and data distributions. We define this issue in DML as threshold inconsistency. In real-world applications, such inconsistency often complicates the threshold selection process when deploying commercial image retrieval systems. To measure this inconsistency, we propose a novel variance-based metric called Operating-Point-Inconsistency-Score (OPIS) that quantifies the variance in the operating characteristics across classes. Using the OPIS metric, we find that achieving high accuracy levels in a DML model does not automatically guarantee threshold consistency. In fact, our investigation reveals a Pareto frontier in the high-accuracy regime, where existing methods to improve accuracy often lead to degradation in threshold consistency. To address this trade-off, we introduce the Threshold-Consistent Margin (TCM) loss, a simple yet effective regularization technique that promotes uniformity in representation structures across classes by selectively penalizing hard sample pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate TCM\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing threshold consistency while preserving accuracy, simplifying the threshold selection process in practical DML settings.",

        "peer_review_with_watermark": "Paper Title: Threshold-Consistent Margin Loss for Open-World Deep Metric Learning\n\nSummary:\nThis paper introduces an innovative strategy aimed at resolving threshold inconsistency in open-world deep metric learning (DML). Threshold inconsistency is the issue where different test classes and data distributions necessitate distinct distance thresholds to maintain equivalent retrieval or recognition accuracy. The authors put forward a variance-based metric called Operating-Point-Inconsistency-Score (OPIS) to measure threshold inconsistency in DML. They also introduce a straightforward yet effective regularization method known as Threshold-Consistent Margin (TCM) loss, which encourages uniformity in representation structures among classes by selectively penalizing challenging sample pairs. The findings indicate that TCM enhances threshold consistency while maintaining accuracy, and OPIS can serve as an additional metric for evaluation alongside recall@k.\n\nStrengths:\n\n1. The paper offers a fresh perspective on tackling threshold inconsistency in open-world DML.\n2. The OPIS metric introduces a comprehensive assessment of errors, balancing both false acceptance rates (FAR) and false rejection rates (FRR).\n3. TCM loss is both simple and effective in enhancing threshold consistency while maintaining accuracy.\n4. The results showcase leading performance in both threshold consistency and accuracy across various image retrieval benchmarks.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n1. While the paper posits that threshold inconsistency poses a significant challenge in open-world DML, it lacks a thorough literature review to substantiate this assertion.\n2. The concept of the OPIS metric might be complex for readers who lack a deep understanding of threshold inconsistency.\n3. The experimental outcomes might be influenced by the selection of hyperparameters, particularly concerning the TCM loss.\n4. The paper does not thoroughly analyze the trade-offs between threshold consistency and accuracy, particularly in high-accuracy scenarios.\n\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n\n1. Carry out a more extensive literature review to validate the assertion that threshold inconsistency is a notable challenge in open-world DML.\n2. Offer clearer explanations regarding the introduction of the OPIS metric.\n3. Conduct more comprehensive ablation studies to explore the impact of hyperparameters on the experimental findings.\n4. Provide a more detailed examination of the trade-offs between threshold consistency and accuracy, especially in high-accuracy contexts.\n\nRecommendation:\nThis paper presents a distinct method for addressing threshold inconsistency in open-world deep metric learning, and the results highlight top-tier performance in both threshold consistency and accuracy. However, further efforts are needed to tackle the limitations and considerations for improvement noted above.\n\nRating: 8/10",

        "abstract": "COMpression with Bayesian Implicit NEural Representations (COMBINER) is a recent data compression method that addresses a key inefficiency of previous Implicit Neural Representation (INR)-based approaches: it avoids quantization and enables direct optimization of the rate-distortion performance. However, COMBINER still has significant limitations: 1) it uses factorized priors and posterior approximations that lack flexibility; 2) it cannot effectively adapt to local deviations from global patterns in the data; and 3) its performance can be susceptible to modeling choices and the variational parameters\u2019 initializations. Our proposed method, Robust and Enhanced COMBINER (RECOMBINER), addresses these issues by 1) enriching the variational approximation while retaining a low computational cost via a linear reparameterization of the INR weights, 2) augmenting our INRs with learnable positional encodings that enable them to adapt to local details and 3) splitting high-resolution data into patches to increase robustness and utilizing expressive hierarchical priors to capture dependency across patches. We conduct extensive experiments across several data modalities, showcasing that RECOMBINER achieves competitive results with the best INR-based methods and even outperforms autoencoder-based codecs on lowresolution images at low bitrates.

Existing methods for generative modeling on manifolds either require expensive simulation, are inherently unable to scale to high dimensions, or use approximations for limiting quantities that result in biased training objectives. Riemannian Flow Matching bypasses these limitations and offers several advantages over previous approaches: it is simulation-free on simple geometries, does not require divergence computation, and computes its target vector field in closed-form. The key ingredient behind RFM is the construction of a relatively simple premetric for defining target vector fields, which encompasses the existing Euclidean case. To extend to general geometries, we rely on the use of spectral decompositions to efficiently compute premetrics on the fly.

However, the memory demands imposed by Transformers limit their ability to handle long sequences, thereby posing challenges in utilizing videos, actions, and other long-form sequences and modalities in complex environments. We present a novel approach, Blockwise RingAttention, which leverages blockwise computation of self-attention and feedforward to distribute long sequences across multiple devices while fully overlapping the communication of key-value blocks with the computation of blockwise attention. Our approach enables training and inference of sequences that are up to device count times longer than those achievable by prior memory-efficient Transformers, without resorting to approximations or incurring additional communication and computation overheads.

        "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great promise in learning node embeddings for link prediction (LP). While numerous studies aim to improve the overall LP performance of GNNs, none have explored its varying performance across different nodes and its underlying reasons. To this end, we aim to demystify which nodes will perform better from the perspective of their local topology. Despite the widespread belief that low-degree nodes exhibit poorer LP performance, our empirical findings provide nuances to this viewpoint and prompt us to propose a better metric, Topological Concentration (TC), based on the intersection of the local subgraph of each node with the ones of its neighbors. We empirically demonstrate that TC has a higher correlation with LP performance than other node-level topological metrics like degree and subgraph density, offering a better way to identify low-performing nodes than using degree. With TC, we discover a novel topological distribution shift issue in which newly joined neighbors of a node tend to become less interactive with that node\u2019s existing neighbors, compromising the generalizability of node embeddings for LP at testing time. To make the computation of TC scalable, We further propose Approximated Topological Concentration (ATC) and theoretically/empirically justify its efficacy in approximating TC and reducing the computation complexity. Given the positive correlation between node TC and its LP performance, we explore the potential of boosting LP performance via enhancing TC by re-weighting edges in the message-passing and discuss its effectiveness with limitations.

        "abstract": "Contrastive learning has emerged as a popular paradigm of self-supervised learning that learns representations by encouraging representations of positive pairs to be similar while representations of negative pairs to be far apart. The spectral contrastive loss, in synergy with the notion of positive-pair graphs, offers valuable theoretical insights into the empirical successes of contrastive learning. In this paper, we propose incorporating an additive factor into the term of spectral contrastive loss involving negative pairs. This simple modification can be equivalently viewed as introducing a regularization term that enforces the mean of representations to be zero, which thus is referred to as zero-mean regularization. It intuitively relaxes the orthogonality of representations between negative pairs and implicitly alleviates the adverse effect of wrong connections in the positive-pair graph, leading to better performance and robustness. To clarify this, we thoroughly investigate the role of zero-mean regularized spectral contrastive loss in both unsupervised and supervised scenarios with respect to theoretical analysis and quantitative evaluation.

Numerous generalization bounds have been proposed in the literature as potential explanations for the ability of neural networks to generalize in the overparameterized setting. However, in their paper \u201cFantastic Generalization Measures and Where to Find Them,\u201d Jiang et al. (2020) examine more than a dozen generalization bounds, and show empirically that none of them are uniformly tight. This raises the question of whether uniformly-tight generalization bounds are at all possible in the overparameterized setting. We consider two types of generalization bounds: (1) bounds that may depend on the training set and the learned hypothesis (e.g., margin bounds). We prove mathematically that no such bound can be uniformly tight in the overparameterized setting; (2) bounds that may in addition also depend on the learning algorithm (e.g., stability bounds). For these bounds, we show a trade-off between the algorithm\u2019s performance and the bound\u2019s tightness. Namely, if the algorithm achieves good accuracy on certain distributions, then no generalization bound can be uniformly tight for it in the overparameterized setting.

        "peer_review_with_watermark": "The study titled \"Fantastic Generalization Measures\" investigates the idea of generalization bounds being uniformly tight, which indicates that the gap between the bound and the population loss is minimal across all learning algorithms and population distributions. The authors put forth two categories of generalization bounds: bounds that are independent of the distribution and algorithm, reliant solely on the training set and learned hypothesis, and bounds that depend on the learning algorithm as well.\n\n**Summary of the Paper:**\nThis paper delves deeply into generalization bounds, particularly in overparameterization contexts. The authors contend that numerous established generalization bounds are either vacuous or fail to maintain uniform tightness when dealing with overparameterization. They introduce two critical concepts: estimability and algorithm-specific estimability, which play a significant role in their findings. The paper presents two primary conclusions: (1) no generalization bound resembling Eq. (1) is uniformly tight in situations of overparameterization; and (2) there exists a trade-off between learning effectiveness and estimability for algorithm-dependent bounds.\n\n**Strengths:**\nThe analysis delivered in the paper is detailed and elucidates the limitations of generalization bounds in overparameterized conditions. The introduction of the two concepts of estimability proves to be essential for their conclusions, and the inclusion of tangible examples effectively illustrates these ideas.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\nAt times, the principal conclusion regarding algorithm-dependent bounds may feel overly technical and hard to comprehend. The assumptions made concerning the suitability of the learning algorithm for Theorem 3 could appear impractical in various situations. Additionally, some technical aspects may come across as being too elaborate.\n\n**Improvement Suggestions:**\nEnhancements to the paper might include the addition of more practical examples to better demonstrate their key findings on algorithm-dependent bounds. Further clarification of their assumptions regarding the appropriateness of the learning algorithm for Theorem 3 could be beneficial, alongside more realistic propositions. Lastly, emphasizing the practical ramifications of their findings and suggesting avenues for ensuing research could add value.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nThe paper offers an engaging and comprehensive exploration of generalization bounds as they relate to overparameterization. While certain technical details may occasionally feel excessive, the core conclusion delivers valuable insights into the limitations associated with generalization bounds in such contexts. We suggest that the paper be published in its current form after implementing some minor revisions to clarify technical aspects and assumptions.",

To tackle such limitations of existing NAS methods, we propose a paradigm shift from NAS to a novel conditional Neural Architecture Generation (NAG) framework based on diffusion models, dubbed DiffusionNAG.

Moreover, with the guidance of parameterized predictors, DiffusionNAG can flexibly generate task-optimal architectures with the desired properties for diverse tasks, by sampling from a region that is more likely to satisfy the properties. This conditional NAG scheme is significantly more efficient than previous NAS schemes which sample the architectures and filter them using the property predictors. We validate the effectiveness of DiffusionNAG through extensive experiments in two predictor-based NAS scenarios: Transferable NAS and Bayesian Optimization (BO)-based NAS. DiffusionNAG achieves superior performance with speedups of up to 20\u00d7 when compared to the baselines on Transferable NAS benchmarks.

However, the rationality of the diffusion process itself receives limited attention, leaving the question of whether the problem is well-posed and well-conditioned. In this paper, we explore a perplexing tendency of diffusion models: they often display the infinite Lipschitz property of the network with respect to time variable near the zero point. We provide theoretical proofs to illustrate the presence of infinite Lipschitz constants and empirical results to confirm it. The Lipschitz singularities pose a threat to the stability and accuracy during both the training and inference processes of diffusion models. Therefore, the mitigation of Lipschitz singularities holds great potential for enhancing the performance of diffusion models. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach, dubbed E-TSDM, which alleviates the Lipschitz singularities of the diffusion model near the zero point of timesteps. Remarkably, our technique yields a substantial improvement in performance. Moreover, as a byproduct of our method, we achieve a dramatic reduction in the Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance of acceleration methods relying on network Lipschitz, including DDIM and DPM-Solver, by over 33%.

To prevent overfitting to a specific domain, Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) reduces source domain\u2019s loss sharpness. Although SAM variants have delivered significant improvements in DG, we highlight that there\u2019s still potential for improvement in generalizing to unknown domains through the exploration on data space. This paper introduces an objective rooted in both parameter and data perturbed regions for domain generalization, coined Unknown Domain Inconsistency Minimization (UDIM). UDIM reduces the loss landscape inconsistency between source domain and unknown domains. As unknown domains are inaccessible, these domains are empirically crafted by perturbing instances from the source domain dataset. In particular, by aligning the loss landscape acquired in the source domain to the loss landscape of perturbed domains, we expect to achieve generalization grounded on these flat minima for the unknown domains. Theoretically, we validate that merging SAM optimization with the UDIM objective establishes an upper bound for the true objective of the DG task. In an empirical aspect, UDIM consistently outperforms SAM variants across multiple DG benchmark datasets. Notably, UDIM shows statistically significant improvements in scenarios with more restrictive domain information, underscoring UDIM\u2019s generalization capability in unseen domains.

        "abstract": "Imposing known physical constraints, such as conservation laws, during neural network training introduces an inductive bias that can improve accuracy, reliability, convergence, and data efficiency for modeling physical dynamics. While such constraints can be softly imposed via loss function penalties, recent advancements in differentiable physics and optimization improve performance by incorporating PDE-constrained optimization as individual layers in neural networks. This enables a stricter adherence to physical constraints. However, imposing hard constraints significantly increases computational and memory costs, especially for complex dynamical systems. This is because it requires solving an optimization problem over a large number of points in a mesh, representing spatial and temporal discretizations, which greatly increases the complexity of the constraint. To address this challenge, we develop a scalable approach to enforce hard physical constraints using Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), which can be used with any neural network architecture. Our approach imposes the constraint over smaller decomposed domains, each of which is solved by an \u201cexpert\u201d through differentiable optimization. During training, each expert independently performs a localized backpropagation step by leveraging the implicit function theorem; the independence of each expert allows for parallelization across multiple GPUs. Compared to standard differentiable optimization, our scalable approach achieves greater accuracy in the neural PDE solver setting for predicting the dynamics of challenging non-linear systems.

        "abstract": "Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) is tasked with learning to achieve multiple goals in an environment purely from offline datasets using sparse reward functions. Offline GCRL is pivotal for developing generalist agents capable of leveraging pre-existing datasets to learn diverse and reusable skills without hand-engineering reward functions. However, contemporary approaches to GCRL based on supervised learning and contrastive learning are often suboptimal in the offline setting. An alternative perspective on GCRL optimizes for occupancy matching, but necessitates learning a discriminator, which subsequently serves as a pseudo-reward for downstream RL. Inaccuracies in the learned discriminator can cascade, negatively influencing the resulting policy. We present a novel approach to GCRL under a new lens of mixture-distribution matching, leading to our discriminator-free method: SMORe. The key insight is combining the occupancy matching perspective of GCRL with a convex dual formulation to derive a learning objective that can better leverage suboptimal offline data. SMORe learns scores or unnormalized densities representing the importance of taking an action at a state for reaching a particular goal. SMORe is principled and our extensive experiments on the fully offline GCRL benchmark composed of robot manipulation and locomotion tasks, including high-dimensional observations, show that SMORe can outperform state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin.",

        "abstract": "It is desirable for an agent to be able to solve a rich variety of problems that can be specified through language in the same environment. A popular approach towards obtaining such agents is to reuse skills learned in prior tasks to generalise compositionally to new ones. However, this is a challenging problem due to the curse of dimensionality induced by the combinatorially large number of ways high-level goals can be combined both logically and temporally in language. To address this problem, we propose a framework where an agent first learns a sufficient set of skill primitives to achieve all high-level goals in its environment. The agent can then flexibly compose them both logically and temporally to provably achieve temporal logic specifications in any regular language, such as regular fragments of linear temporal logic. This provides the agent with the ability to map from complex temporal logic task specifications to near-optimal behaviours zero-shot. We demonstrate this experimentally in a tabular setting, as well as in a high-dimensional video game and continuous control environment. Finally, we also demonstrate that the performance of skill machines can be improved with regular off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms when optimal behaviours are desired.",

By incorporating a 3D Gaussian representation of surface normals, GNeRP achieves detailed geometric capture, including high-frequency details frequently missed by current techniques.\n\nThe GNeRP architecture employs 2D Gaussians, which are directly informed by polarization priors, enhancing performance in areas dominated by diffuse reflections.

        "abstract": "Recent advancements in autonomous driving have relied on data-driven approaches, which are widely adopted but face challenges including dataset bias, overfitting, and uninterpretability. Drawing inspiration from the knowledge-driven nature of human driving, we explore the question of how to instill similar capabilities into autonomous driving systems and summarize a paradigm that integrates an interactive environment, a driver agent, as well as a memory component to address this question. Leveraging large language models (LLMs) with emergent abilities, we propose the DiLu framework, which combines a Reasoning and a Reflection module to enable the system to perform decision-making based on common-sense knowledge and evolve continuously. Extensive experiments prove DiLu\u2019s capability to accumulate experience and demonstrate a significant advantage in generalization ability over reinforcement learning-based methods. Moreover, DiLu is able to directly acquire experiences from real-world datasets which highlights its potential to be deployed on practical autonomous driving systems. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to leverage knowledge-driven capability in decision-making for autonomous vehicles.

        "title": "GENERALIZATION: UNRAVELING LEARNING DIFFER-",
        "abstract": "This paper investigates discrepancies in how neural networks learn from different imaging domains, which are commonly overlooked when adopting computer vision techniques from the domain of natural images to other specialized domains such as medical images. Recent works have found that the generalization error of a trained network typically increases with the intrinsic dimension (ddata) of its training set. Yet, the steepness of this relationship varies significantly between medical (radiological) and natural imaging domains, with no existing theoretical explanation. We address this gap in knowledge by establishing and empirically validating a generalization scaling law with respect to ddata, and propose that the substantial scaling discrepancy between the two considered domains may be at least partially attributed to the higher intrinsic \u201clabel sharpness\u201d (KF ) of medical imaging datasets, a metric which we propose. Next, we demonstrate an additional benefit of measuring the label sharpness of a training set: it is negatively correlated with the trained model\u2019s adversarial robustness, which notably leads to models for medical images having a substantially higher vulnerability to adversarial attack. Finally, we extend our ddata formalism to the related metric of learned representation intrinsic dimension (drepr), derive a generalization scaling law with respect to drepr, and show that ddata serves as an upper bound for drepr. Our theoretical results are supported by thorough experiments with six models and eleven natural and medical imaging datasets over a range of training set sizes. Our findings offer insights into the influence of intrinsic dataset properties on generalization, representation learning, and robustness in deep neural networks.1",

The authors formulate a generalization scaling law pertaining to intrinsic dimension and present a metric for intrinsic label sharpness. Findings indicate that the enhanced intrinsic label sharpness in medical datasets could account for the contrasting generalization ability scaling rates observed between natural and medical image datasets. Additionally, the authors demonstrate that there is a negative correlation between higher intrinsic label sharpness and the adversarial robustness of models. This research has significant implications for designing neural networks capable of managing diverse datasets while enhancing their resilience against adversarial threats.\n\nStrengths:\n1. The paper delivers an in-depth examination of the connections between neural network generalization capabilities, the intrinsic dimension of training sets, and the intrinsic label sharpness of datasets. Introducing intrinsic label sharpness as a new metric enriches the analysis.\n2. The empirical assessment of the model across numerous datasets from both natural and medical imaging fields provides strong evidence supporting the proposed correlations. The experiments take into account various variables that may affect the outcomes, such as model architectures, training set sizes, and dataset attributes.\n3. The derivations of Theorems 1, 2, 3, and 4 offer clear clarifications on how the performance of neural networks relates to the intrinsic characteristics of datasets. The proofs for Theorems 3 and 4 equip necessary insights into the consequences of high intrinsic label sharpness regarding model robustness and representation learning.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. The focus of the analysis is primarily on binary classification datasets. Expanding this to include multi-class classification datasets could yield further insights into how neural network performance interacts with the intrinsic characteristics of datasets. Evaluating other machine learning models might also provide broader perspectives on this issue.\n2. The analysis omits other factors that could influence neural network performance. Investigating how hyperparameter tuning, model pruning, and transfer learning affect neural network capabilities could enrich the understanding of this topic. A broader examination of neural networks across diverse datasets may contribute to a deeper comprehension of the challenge.\n3. A more thorough discussion of the practical implications stemming from this analysis could foster a greater understanding of the issue at hand. Exploring these implications in detail would lead to more profound insights into the problem.

        "abstract": "We deal with the combinatorial problem of learning directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure from observational data adhering to a linear structural equation model (SEM). Leveraging advances in differentiable, nonconvex characterizations of acyclicity, recent efforts have advocated a continuous constrained optimization paradigm to efficiently explore the space of DAGs. Most existing methods employ lasso-type score functions to guide this search, which (i) require expensive penalty parameter retuning when the unknown SEM noise variances change across problem instances; and (ii) implicitly rely on limiting homoscedasticity assumptions. In this work, we propose a new convex score function for sparsity-aware learning of linear DAGs, which incorporates concomitant estimation of scale and thus effectively decouples the sparsity parameter from the exogenous noise levels. Regularization via a smooth, nonconvex acyclicity penalty term yields CoLiDE (Concomitant Linear DAG Estimation), a regression-based criterion amenable to efficient gradient computation and closed-form estimation of noise variances in heteroscedastic scenarios. Our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods without incurring added complexity, especially when the DAGs are larger and the noise level profile is heterogeneous. We also find CoLiDE exhibits enhanced stability manifested via reduced standard deviations in several domain-specific metrics, underscoring the robustness of our novel linear DAG estimator.",

The results show that CoLiDE outperforms leading methods across diverse experimental scenarios involving both homoscedastic and heteroscedastic linear Gaussian Structural Equation Models (SEMs).\n\n$$$$Strengths:\nA significant advantage of CoLiDE is its capability to estimate DAGs under varying noise conditions, including both homoscedastic and heteroscedastic scenarios. It exhibits robustness across different graph sizes, including dense graphs containing up to 200 nodes. Moreover, CoLiDE surpasses other cutting-edge methods, such as GOLEM, DAGuerreotype, and TOPO, by not requiring prior knowledge of noise variance\u2014an often unknown factor in real-world situations\u2014thus eliminating the necessity for hyperparameter adjustments.\n\n$$$$Weaknesses:\nCoLiDE does not account for non-identifiable linear Gaussian SEMs, which cannot be identified through observational data, except in the specific case where all noise shares the same variance (homoscedastic scenario). Additionally, the framework fails to address non-Gaussian errors that may occur in linear Gaussian SEMs, consequently limiting its applicability across different environments.\n\n$$$$Suggestions for Improvement:\nTo enhance the CoLiDE framework, it should be adapted to evaluate non-identifiable linear Gaussian SEMs. This could involve integrating additional methodologies, such as Bayesian approaches and techniques for dealing with non-Gaussian errors, to effectively manage non-identifiability.",

Although successful, previous works do not account for the specific localization of said attributes extended into the three dimensional plane. In this context, we present a conditional diffusion model that integrates control over three-dimensional object placement with disentangled representations of global stylistic semantics from multiple exemplar images. Specifically, we first introduce depth disentanglement training to leverage the relative depth of objects as an estimator, allowing the model to identify the absolute positions of unseen objects through the use of synthetic image triplets. We also introduce soft guidance, a method for imposing global semantics onto targeted regions without the use of any additional localization cues. Our integrated framework, COMPOSE AND CONQUER (CNC), unifies these techniques to localize multiple conditions in a disentangled manner. We demonstrate that our approach allows perception of objects at varying depths while offering a versatile framework for composing localized objects with different global semantics.",

However, existing networks typically cannot handle complex geometries and inhomogeneous boundary values present in the real world. Here we introduce Boundary-Embedded Neural Operators (BENO), a novel neural operator architecture that embeds the complex geometries and inhomogeneous boundary values into the solving of elliptic PDEs.

Furthermore, a Transformer encoder maps the global boundary geometry into a latent vector which influences each message passing layer of the GNNs. We test our model extensively in elliptic PDEs with various boundary conditions. We show that all existing baseline methods fail to learn the solution operator.

As examples are often an under-specification of one\u2019s intent, a good synthesizer must choose the intended program from the many that are consistent with the given set of examples. Prior work frames program synthesis as a cooperative game between a listener (that synthesizes programs) and a speaker (a user choosing examples), and shows that models of computational pragmatic inference are effective in choosing the user intended programs. However, these models require counterfactual reasoning over a large set of programs and examples, which is infeasible in realistic program spaces. In this paper, we propose a novel way to amortize this search with neural networks. We sample pairs of programs and examples via self-play between listener and speaker models, and use pragmatic inference to choose informative training examples from this sample. We then use the informative dataset to train models to improve the synthesizer\u2019s ability to disambiguate user-provided examples without human supervision. We validate our method on the challenging task of synthesizing regular expressions from example strings, and find that our method (1) outperforms models trained without choosing pragmatic examples by 23% (a 51% relative increase) (2) matches the performance of supervised learning on a dataset of pragmatic examples provided by humans, despite using no human data in training.",

Semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations have recently been proposed for solving the K-means optimization problem that enjoy strong statistical optimality guarantees, but the prohibitive cost of implementing an SDP solver renders these guarantees inaccessible to practical datasets. By contrast, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a simple clustering algorithm that is widely used by machine learning practitioners, but without a solid statistical underpinning nor rigorous guarantees. In this paper, we describe an NMF-like algorithm that works by solving a nonnegative low-rank restriction of the SDP relaxed K-means formulation using a nonconvex Burer\u2013Monteiro factorization approach. The resulting algorithm is just as simple and scalable as state-of-theart NMF algorithms, while also enjoying the same strong statistical optimality guarantees as the SDP.

Sparsification provides a solution to alleviate these resource constraints, and recent works have shown that trained models can be sparsified post-hoc. Existing sparsification techniques face challenges as they need additional data structures and offer constrained speedup with current hardware. In this paper we present SliceGPT, a new post-training sparsification scheme which replaces each weight matrix with a smaller (dense) matrix, reducing the embedding dimension of the network. Through extensive experimentation, we show that SliceGPT can remove up to 25% of the model parameters (including embeddings) for OPT 66B and LLAMA-2 70B models with modest loss in accuracy (superior to 2:4 sparsity). Our sliced models run on fewer GPUs and run faster without any additional code optimization: on 24GB consumer GPUs we reduce the total compute for inference on LLAMA-2 70B to 64% of that of the dense model; on 40GB A100 GPUs we reduce it to 66%.

        "abstract": "In federated learning (FL), data heterogeneity is one key bottleneck that causes model divergence and limits performance. Addressing this, existing methods often regard data heterogeneity as an inherent property and propose to mitigate its adverse effects by correcting models. In this paper, we seek to break this inherent property by generating data to complement the original dataset to fundamentally mitigate heterogeneity level. As a novel attempt from the perspective of data, we propose federated learning with consensus-oriented generation (FedCOG). FedCOG consists of two key components at the client side: complementary data generation, which generates data extracted from the shared global model to complement the original dataset, and knowledge-distillation-based model training, which distills knowledge from global model to local model based on the generated data to mitigate over-fitting the original heterogeneous dataset. FedCOG has two critical advantages: 1) it can be a plug-and-play module to further improve the performance of most existing FL methods, and 2) it is naturally compatible with standard FL protocols such as Secure Aggregation since it makes no modification in communication process. Extensive experiments on classical and real-world FL datasets show that FedCOG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods .",

        "abstract": "Transformer models have demonstrated high accuracy in numerous applications but have high complexity and lack sequential processing capability making them ill-suited for many streaming applications at the edge where devices are heavily resource-constrained. Thus motivated, many researchers have proposed reformulating the transformer models as RNN modules which modify the self-attention computation with explicit states. However, these approaches often incur significant performance degradation. The ultimate goal is to develop a model that has the following properties: parallel training, streaming and low-cost inference, and state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. In this paper, we propose a new direction to achieve this goal. We show how architectural modifications to a fully-sequential recurrent model can help push its performance toward Transformer models while retaining its sequential processing capability. Specifically, inspired by the recent success of Legendre Memory Units (LMU) in sequence learning tasks, we propose LMUFormer, which augments the LMU with convolutional patch embedding and convolutional channel mixer. Moreover, we present a spiking version of this architecture, which introduces the benefit of states within the patch embedding and channel mixer modules while simultaneously reducing the computing complexity. We evaluated our architectures on multiple sequence datasets. Of particular note is our performance on the Speech Commands V2 dataset (35 classes). In comparison to SOTA transformer-based models within the ANN domain, our LMUFormer demonstrates comparable performance while necessitating a remarkable 53\u00d7 reduction in parameters and a substantial 65\u00d7 decrement in FLOPs. Furthermore, when benchmarked against extant low-complexity SNN variants, our model establishes a new SOTA with an accuracy of 96.12%. Additionally, owing to our model\u2019s proficiency in real-time data processing, we are able to achieve a 32.03% reduction in sequence length, all while incurring an inconsequential decline in performance.

To this end, we propose motion guidance, a zero-shot technique that allows a user to specify dense, complex motion fields that indicate where each pixel in an image should move. Motion guidance works by steering the diffusion sampling process with the gradients through an off-the-shelf optical flow network. Specifically, we design a guidance loss that encourages the sample to have the desired motion, as estimated by a flow network, while also being visually similar to the source image.

The authors give an extensive summary of their technique and its potential uses.\n\nThe motion guidance method proposed by the authors incorporates a readily available optical flow network to facilitate the diffusion sampling procedure. They conceptualize a guidance loss function that aims to generate samples exhibiting the desired motion while maintaining visual similarity to the original image. This technique is assessed through qualitative and quantitative analyses of both real and synthetic images.\n\nSeveral advantages of the authors' method include:\n\n*   The capacity to accurately modify the layout, placement, posture, and form of elements within images utilizing a zero-shot method.\n*   The application of a standard optical flow network that can be customized for various image types.\n*   The capability to manage complex movements and produce high-quality edits.\n*   The design of a guidance loss function that optimally balances motion and visual fidelity.\n*   The ability to address occlusions and disocclusions with the aid of an occlusion mask.\n*   The implementation of a recursive denoising technique to enhance the stability of the optimization process.\n*   The success in executing motion edits on both real and synthetic images.\n\nOn the downside, the method also has a few limitations, such as:\n\n*   Sensitivity to the performance quality of the optical flow network utilized.\n*   The potential ineffectiveness of the guidance loss function across different image types.\n*   A likelihood of requiring extensive computational resources.\n*   Possible restrictions concerning the types of motion that can be edited.\n*   Limitations pertaining to the kinds of images that can undergo editing.\n\nIn summary, the proposed method shows great promise for motion guidance via diffusion models. With additional refinement and advancements, it may lead to high-quality edits with enhanced stability and resilience.\n\nThe authors' strategy of employing a guidance loss function that balances the two aspects of motion and visual fidelity is a notable strength. However, the effectiveness of this loss function in capturing the intricacies of motion guidance may also face challenges.\n\nThe application of an occlusion mask to manage disocclusions represents another significant advantage of the proposed method, though there may be concerns about the mask\u2019s ability to address the complexities of disocclusions.\n\nAdditionally, the recursive denoising technique employed to solidify the optimization process stands out as a valuable strength, yet its efficacy in encapsulating the details of motion guidance could be limited.\n\nThe authors successfully perform motion edits on both real and synthetic images, marking another strength. However, they may encounter challenges in dealing with intricate motions effectively.\n\nOverall, the proposed method holds substantial potential for motion guidance via diffusion models. With further refinement and improvement, it could yield high-quality edits alongside greater stability and robustness.\n\nEnhancements can be pursued by refining the guidance loss function, the occlusion mask, and the recursive denoising technique. There could also be chances to advance the method by integrating more advanced motion estimation or image manipulation models.\n\nFuture research may explore the following areas to further develop the proposed approach:\n\n*   Creating advanced motion estimation models.\n*   Formulating sophisticated image manipulation models.\n*   Focusing on enhancing the stability and robustness of the method.\n*   Assessing the use of the proposed method for other image manipulation tasks.\n*   Exploring applications of the proposed method for various image guidance tasks.\n\nIn conclusion, the proposed method showcases substantial potential for motion guidance utilizing diffusion models.

While various methods have been developed to address this confounding issue, they often rely on strong assumptions about the underlying causal structure. In this paper, we consider a general scenario where measured and latent variables collectively form a partially observed causally sufficient linear system and latent variables may be anywhere in the causal structure. We theoretically show that with the aid of high-order statistics, the causal graph is (almost) fully identifiable if, roughly speaking, each latent set has a sufficient number of pure children, which can be either latent or measured. Naturally, LiNGAM, a model without latent variables, is encompassed as a special case. Based on the identification theorem, we develop a principled algorithm to identify the causal graph by testing for statistical independence involving only measured variables in specific manners. Experimental results show that our method effectively recovers the causal structure, even when latent variables are influenced by measured variables.",

        "abstract": "Generative models have shown remarkable progress in 3D aspect. Recent works learn 3D representation explicitly under text-3D guidance. However, limited text3D data restricts the vocabulary scale and text control of generations. Generators may easily fall into a stereotype concept for certain text prompts, thus losing openvocabulary generation ability. To tackle this issue, we introduce a conditional 3D generative model, namely TextField3D.Specifically, rather than using the text prompts as input directly, we suggest to inject dynamic noise into the latent space of given text prompts, i.e., Noisy Text Fields (NTFs). In this way, limited 3D data can be mapped to the appropriate range of textual latent space that is expanded by NTFs. To this end, an NTFGen module is proposed to model general text latent code in noisy fields. Meanwhile, an NTFBind module is proposed to align viewinvariant image latent code to noisy fields, further supporting image-conditional 3D generation. To guide the conditional generation in both geometry and texture, multi-modal discrimination is constructed with a text-3D discriminator and a text2.5D discriminator. Compared to previous methods, TextField3D includes three merits: 1) large vocabulary, 2) text consistency, and 3) low latency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a potential open-vocabulary 3D generation capability.",

Recent studies focus on explicitly learning 3D representations guided by text-3D inputs. However, the scarcity of text3D data limits the range of vocabulary and the degree of control over generated outputs.

        "abstract": "Despite many successful examples in which probabilistic inference can account for perception, we have little understanding of how the brain represents and uses structured priors that capture the complexity of natural input statistics. Here we construct a recurrent circuit model that can implicitly represent priors over latent variables, and combine them with sensory and contextual sources of information to encode task-specific posteriors. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models as means of learning and using priors over images, our model uses dendritic nonlinearities optimized for denoising, and stochastic somatic integration with the degree of noise modulated by an oscillating global signal. Combining these elements into a recurrent network yields a dynamical system that samples from the prior at a rate prescribed by the period of the global oscillator. Additional inputs reflecting sensory or top-down contextual information alter these dynamics to generate samples from the corresponding posterior, with different input gating patterns selecting different inference tasks. We demonstrate that this architecture can sample from low dimensional nonlinear manifolds and multimodal posteriors. Overall, the model provides a new framework for circuit-level representation of probabilistic information, in a format that facilitates flexible inference.",

This paper establishes a unified framework for Riemannian Batch Normalization (RBN) techniques on Lie groups. Our framework offers the theoretical guarantee of controlling both the Riemannian mean and variance. Empirically, we focus on Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifolds, which possess three distinct types of Lie group structures. Using the deformation concept, we generalize the existing Lie groups on SPD manifolds into three families of parameterized Lie groups. Specific normalization layers induced by these Lie groups are then proposed for SPD neural networks.

        "abstract": "Hypernetworks, neural networks that predict the parameters of another neural network, are powerful models that have been successfully used in diverse applications from image generation to multi-task learning. Unfortunately, existing hypernetworks are often challenging to train. Training typically converges far more slowly than for non-hypernetwork models, and the rate of convergence can be very sensitive to hyperparameter choices. In this work, we identify a fundamental and previously unidentified problem that contributes to the challenge of training hypernetworks: a magnitude proportionality between the inputs and outputs of the hypernetwork. We demonstrate both analytically and empirically that this can lead to unstable optimization, thereby slowing down convergence, and sometimes even preventing any learning. We present a simple solution to this problem using a revised hypernetwork formulation that we call Magnitude Invariant Parametrizations (MIP). We demonstrate the proposed solution on several hypernetwork tasks, where it consistently stabilizes training and achieves faster convergence. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive ablation study including choices of activation function, normalization strategies, input dimensionality, and hypernetwork architecture; and find that MIP improves training in all scenarios. We also provide easy-to-use code that can turn existing networks into MIP-based hypernetworks.",

        "abstract": "Due to privacy or patent concerns, a growing number of large models are released without granting access to their training data, making transferring their knowledge inefficient and problematic. In response, Data-Free Knowledge Distillation (DFKD) methods have emerged as direct solutions. However, simply adopting models derived from DFKD for real-world applications suffers significant performance degradation, due to the discrepancy between teachers\u2019 training data and real-world scenarios (student domain). The degradation stems from the portions of teachers\u2019 knowledge that are not applicable to the student domain. They are specific to the teacher domain and would undermine students\u2019 performance. Hence, selectively transferring teachers\u2019 appropriate knowledge becomes the primary challenge in DFKD. In this work, we propose a simple but effective method AuG-KD. It utilizes an uncertainty-guided and sample-specific anchor to align student-domain data with the teacher domain and leverages a generative method to progressively trade off the learning process between OOD knowledge distillation and domain-specific information learning via mixup learning. Extensive experiments in 3 datasets and 8 settings demonstrate the stability and superiority of our approach. Code available at https://github.com/IshiKura-a/AuG-KD",

        "abstract": "Despite the advancements of open-source large language models (LLMs), e.g., LLaMA, they remain significantly limited in tool-use capabilities, i.e., using external tools (APIs) to fulfill human instructions. The reason is that current instruction tuning largely focuses on basic language tasks but ignores the tool-use domain. This is in contrast to the excellent tool-use capabilities of state-of-the-art (SOTA) closed-source LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT. To bridge this gap, we introduce ToolLLM, a general tool-use framework encompassing data construction, model training, and evaluation. We first present ToolBench, an instruction-tuning dataset for tool use, which is constructed automatically using ChatGPT. Specifically, the construction can be divided into three stages: (i) API collection: we collect 16, 464 real-world RESTful APIs spanning 49 categories from RapidAPI Hub; (ii) instruction generation: we prompt ChatGPT to generate diverse instructions involving these APIs, covering both single-tool and multi-tool scenarios; (iii) solution path annotation: we use ChatGPT to search for a valid solution path (chain of API calls) for each instruction. To enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we develop a novel depth-first search-based decision tree algorithm. It enables LLMs to evaluate multiple reasoning traces and expand the search space. Moreover, to evaluate the tool-use capabilities of LLMs, we develop an automatic evaluator: ToolEval. Based on ToolBench, we fine-tune LLaMA to obtain an LLM ToolLLaMA, and equip it with a neural API retriever to recommend appropriate APIs for each instruction. Experiments show that ToolLLaMA demonstrates a remarkable ability to execute complex instructions and generalize to unseen APIs, and exhibits comparable performance to ChatGPT. Our ToolLLaMA also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization ability in an out-of-distribution tool-use dataset: APIBench. The codes, trained models, and demo are publicly available at https://github.com/OpenBMB/ToolBench.",

        "abstract": "High accuracy, low latency and high energy efficiency represent a set of conflicting goals when searching for system solutions for image classification and detection. While high-quality images naturally result in more precise detection and classification, they also result in a heavier computational workload for imaging and processing, reduced camera frame rates, and increased data communication between the camera and processor. Taking inspiration from the foveal-peripheral sampling mechanism, and saccade mechanism of the human visual system and the filling-in phenomena of brain, we have developed an active scene reconstruction architecture based on multiple foveal views. This model stitches together information from a sequence of foveal-peripheral views, which are sampled from multiple glances. Assisted by a reinforcement learning-based saccade mechanism, our model reduces the required input pixels by over 90% per frame while maintaining the same level of performance in image recognition as with the original images. We evaluated the effectiveness of our model using the GTSRB dataset and the ImageNet dataset. Using an equal number of input pixels, our model demonstrates a 5% higher image recognition accuracy compared to state-of-theart foveal-peripheral based vision systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our foveal sampling/saccadic scene reconstruction model exhibits significantly lower complexity and higher data efficiency during the training phase compared to existing approaches. Code is available at Github.",

The proposed system employs a foveal-peripheral sampling mechanism, which reduces the amount of input data required for image processing. The system also incorporates a scene reconstruction module, which stitches together information from multiple foveal-peripheral views to generate a reconstructed image. The saccade controller is trained using reinforcement learning to optimize the sampling strategy and improve the classification accuracy.\n\nStrengths:\n\n1. The proposed system demonstrates high data efficiency during the training phase, requiring only a small portion of the training data to achieve similar performance to state-of-the-art foveal-peripheral based vision systems.\n2. The system achieves a 5% higher image recognition accuracy compared to state-of-the-art foveal-peripheral based vision systems, while reducing the required input pixels by over 90% per frame.\n3. The saccade model is highly transferable and works effectively on scenes that differ from the training classes.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n1. The system requires a significant amount of computational resources for training the saccade controller and the scene reconstruction module.\n2. The proposed system assumes a fixed foveal-peripheral sampling mechanism, which may not be effective for all types of images or scenes.\n3. The system does not consider the impact of occlusions or other forms of visual degradation on the classification accuracy.\n\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n\n1. Investigate alternative foveal-peripheral sampling mechanisms that can adapt to different types of images or scenes.\n2.

The architecture, named \"foveal-peripheral sampling and saccadic scene reconstruction,\" integrates several foveal-peripheral views governed by saccades into a composite image, which minimizes the number of input pixels while preserving performance levels in image recognition. The framework attains state-of-the-art results regarding top-1 accuracy and reduces pixel consumption by as much as 70%. The experimental findings highlight the success of this approach across both the GTSRB and ImageNet datasets.\n\nStrengths:\n\n1. The method is energy-efficient, achieving a reduction in pixel consumption of up to 70% while still delivering leading performance in image recognition.\n2. By employing foveal-peripheral sampling alongside saccadic scene reconstruction, the method outperforms existing foveal-peripheral vision systems.\n3. The technique is highly adaptable, allowing the trained saccade model to be applied in various scenes beyond the training categories.\n4. Incorporating self-supervised learning in the predictive reconstruction segment and reinforcement learning in the saccade controller promotes data efficiency throughout the training process.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n1. This approach is dependent on complex models such as ConvLSTM, Resnet, and reinforcement learning, which may result in high computational costs.\n2. Experimental outcomes present variability in top-1 accuracy, potentially due to differences in sampling methodologies, models, or evaluation criteria.\n3. It overlooks potential complications related to human variability, environmental factors, or sensor noise, which could affect the system's robustness.\n4. Some experiments, particularly those focused on data-efficient policy training, reveal inconsistent results, likely due to differences in training methods, data distributions, or model designs.\n\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n\n1. Additional research is needed to create more robust sampling methodologies, models, or evaluation techniques to lessen variability in experimental findings.\n2. To tackle potential challenges stemming from human variability, environmental influences, or sensor noise, it might be beneficial to develop more thorough evaluation protocols or strategies for noise resilience.\n3. Exploring advanced reinforcement learning strategies, improved data sampling techniques, or hybrid models that integrate self-supervised and label-based learning could enhance data efficiency.\n4. For greater generalizability, consider building more comprehensive models or frameworks that can better accommodate variations in sensor types, environmental conditions, or human differences.\n\nRecommendation:\n\nGiven the experimental outcomes, top-1 accuracy, and data efficiency achieved, I strongly endorse the proposed approach as an innovative energy-efficient front-end sensing system, particularly suited for applications necessitating real-time or near-real-time image recognition, such as in security, healthcare, or autonomous driving.

Existing practices tend to ignore the multiple facets of item characteristics, which may not capture it at appropriate granularity. Moreover, current studies equate the granularity of item space to that of user interests, which we postulate is not ideal as user interests would likely map to a small subset of item space. In addition, the compositionality of user interests has received inadequate attention, preventing the modeling of interactions between explanatory factors driving a user\u2019s decision. To resolve this, we propose to align user interests with multi-faceted item characteristics. First, we involve prototype-based representation learning to discover item characteristics along multiple facets. Second, we compose user interests from uncovered item characteristics via binding mechanism, separating the granularity of user preferences from that of item space. Third, we design a dedicated bi-directional binding block, aiding the derivation of compositional user interests.

Existing works mostly target smooth unconstrained objectives in Euclidean space, whereas ML problems often involve constraints or non-smooth regularization, which results in a need for composite optimization. Moreover, although non-smooth regularization often serves to induce structure (e.g., sparsity), standard aggregation schemes in distributed optimization break this structure. Addressing these issues, we propose Federated Dual Extrapolation (FeDualEx), an extra-step primal-dual algorithm with local updates, which is the first of its kind to encompass both saddle point optimization and composite objectives under the distributed paradigm. Using a generalized notion of Bregman divergence, we analyze its convergence and communication complexity in the homogeneous setting.

Our defense falls within the category of post-development defenses that operate independently of how the model was generated. Our proposed defense is built upon an intriguing concept: given a backdoored model, we reverse engineer it to directly extract its backdoor functionality to a backdoor expert model. To accomplish this, we finetune the backdoored model over a small set of intentionally mislabeled clean samples, such that it unlearns the normal functionality while still preserving the backdoor functionality, and thus resulting in a model (dubbed a backdoor expert model) that can only recognize backdoor inputs. Based on the extracted backdoor expert model, we show the feasibility of devising robust backdoor input detectors that filter out the backdoor inputs during model inference. Further augmented by an ensemble strategy with a finetuned auxiliary model, our defense, BaDExpert (Backdoor Input Detection with Backdoor Expert), effectively mitigates 17 SOTA backdoor attacks while minimally impacting clean utility. The effectiveness of BaDExpert has been verified on multiple datasets (CIFAR10, GTSRB, and ImageNet) across multiple model architectures (ResNet, VGG, MobileNetV2, and Vision Transformer).

        "title": "PARETO DEEP LONG-TAILED RECOGNITION: A CONFLICT-AVERSE SOLUTION",
        "abstract": "Deep long-tailed recognition (DLTR) has attracted much attention due to its close touch with realistic scenarios. Recent advances have focused on re-balancing across various aspects, e.g., sampling strategy, loss re-weighting, logit adjustment, and input/parameter perturbation, etc. However, few studies have considered dynamic re-balancing to address intrinsic optimization conflicts, which are identified as prevalent and critical issues in this study. In this paper, we empirically establish the severity of the optimization conflict issue in the DLTR scenario, which leads to a degradation of representation learning. This observation serves as the motivation for pursuing Pareto optimal solutions. Unfortunately, a straightforward integration of multi-objective optimization (MOO) with DLTR methods is infeasible due to the disparity between multi-task learning (MTL) and DLTR. Therefore, we propose effective alternatives by decoupling MOO-based MTL from a temporal perspective rather than a structural one. Furthermore, we enhance the integration of MOO and DLTR by investigating the generalization and convergence problems. Specifically, we propose optimizing the variability collapse loss, guided by the derived MOObased DLTR generalization bound, to improve generalization. Additionally, we anticipate worst-case optimization to ensure convergence. Building upon the proposed MOO framework, we introduce a novel method called Pareto deep LOngTailed recognition (PLOT). Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method not only generally improves mainstream pipelines, but also achieves an augmented version to realize state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) often demonstrate inconsistencies with human preferences. Previous research typically gathered human preference data and then aligned the pre-trained models using reinforcement learning or instruction tuning, a.k.a. the finetuning step. In contrast, aligning frozen LLMs without requiring alignment data is more appealing. This work explores the potential of the latter setting. We discover that by integrating self-evaluation and rewind mechanisms, unaligned LLMs can directly produce responses consistent with human preferences via self-boosting. We introduce a novel inference method, Rewindable Auto-regressive INference (RAIN), that allows pre-trained LLMs to evaluate their own generation and use the evaluation results to guide rewind and generation for AI safety. Notably, RAIN operates without the need of extra data for model alignment and abstains from any training, gradient computation, or parameter updates. Experimental results evaluated by GPT-4 and humans demonstrate the effectiveness of RAIN: on the HH dataset, RAIN improves the harmlessness rate of LLaMA 30B from 82% of vanilla inference to 97%, while maintaining the helpfulness rate. On the TruthfulQA dataset, RAIN improves the truthfulness of the already-well-aligned LLaMA-2-chat 13B model by 5%. The code is available at https://github.com/SafeAILab/RAIN.",

        "abstract": "The current face recognition (FR) algorithms has achieved a high level of accuracy, making further improvements increasingly challenging. While existing FR algorithms primarily focus on optimizing margins and loss functions, limited attention has been given to exploring the feature representation space. Therefore, this paper endeavors to improve FR performance in the view of feature representation space. Firstly, we consider two FR models that exhibit distinct performance discrepancies, where one model exhibits superior recognition accuracy compared to the other. We implement orthogonal decomposition on the features from the superior model along those from the inferior model and obtain two sub-features. Surprisingly, we find the sub-feature orthogonal to the inferior still possesses a certain level of face distinguishability. We adjust the modulus of the sub-features and recombine them through vector addition. Experiments demonstrate this recombination is likely to contribute to an improved facial feature representation, even better than features from the original superior model. Motivated by this discovery, we further consider how to improve FR accuracy when there is only one FR model available. Inspired by knowledge distillation, we incorporate the intraclass incoherence constraint (IIC) to solve the problem. Experiments on various FR benchmarks show the existing state-of-the-art method with IIC can be further improved, highlighting its potential to further enhance FR performance.",

        "abstract": "Graph transformers (GTs) have emerged as a promising architecture that is theoretically more expressive than message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs). However, typical GT models have at least quadratic complexity and thus cannot scale to large graphs. While there are several linear GTs recently proposed, they still lag behind GNN counterparts on several popular graph datasets, which poses a critical concern on their practical expressivity. To balance the trade-off between expressivity and scalability of GTs, we propose Polynormer, a polynomialexpressive GT model with linear complexity. Polynormer is built upon a novel base model that learns a high-degree polynomial on input features. To enable the base model permutation equivariant, we integrate it with graph topology and node features separately, resulting in local and global equivariant attention models. Consequently, Polynormer adopts a linear local-to-global attention scheme to learn high-degree equivariant polynomials whose coefficients are controlled by attention scores. Polynormer has been evaluated on 13 homophilic and heterophilic datasets, including large graphs with millions of nodes. Our extensive experiment results show that Polynormer outperforms state-of-the-art GNN and GT baselines on most datasets, even without the use of nonlinear activation functions.

In this paper, we address this question \u201cCan we design an interpretable 3D visual grounding framework that has the potential to mimic the human perception system?\u201d. To this end, we formulate the 3D visual grounding problem as a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) task by first predicting a chain of anchors and then the final target. Interpretability not only improves the overall performance but also helps us identify failure cases. Following the chain of thoughts approach enables us to decompose the referring task into interpretable intermediate steps, boosting the performance and making our framework extremely data-efficient. Moreover, our proposed framework can be easily integrated into any existing architecture. We validate our approach through comprehensive experiments on the Nr3D, Sr3D, and Scanrefer benchmarks and show consistent performance gains compared to existing methods without requiring manually annotated data. Furthermore, our proposed framework, dubbed CoT3DRef, is significantly data-efficient, whereas on the Sr3D dataset, when trained only on 10% of the data, we match the SOTA performance that trained on the entire data.

In this paper, we consider the generalization where other agents or external events also intervene on the system, which is key for enabling adaptiveness to non-stationarities such as weather changes, market forces, or adversaries. We formalize this generalization of CBO as Adversarial Causal Bayesian Optimization (ACBO) and introduce the first algorithm for ACBO with bounded regret: Causal Bayesian Optimization with Multiplicative Weights (CBO-MW). Our approach combines a classical online learning strategy with causal modeling of the rewards. To achieve this, it computes optimistic counterfactual reward estimates by propagating uncertainty through the causal graph. We derive regret bounds for CBO-MW that naturally depend on graph-related quantities. We further propose a scalable implementation for the case of combinatorial interventions and submodular rewards. Empirically, CBO-MW outperforms non-causal and non-adversarial Bayesian optimization methods on synthetic environments and environments based on real-word data.

These models are built on an innovative instruction-tuning dataset named MathInstruct, which blends chain-of-thought (CoT) and program-of-thought (PoT) reasoning approaches to ensure comprehensive coverage across various mathematical areas and complexity levels. The method proposed demonstrates considerable improvements over current open-source models on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, achieving notable accuracy enhancements, particularly with out-of-domain datasets.\n\n\\section{Strengths}\nA significant advantage of this approach is the development of the MathInstruct dataset, which effectively overcomes the shortcomings of existing datasets. The integrated CoT & PoT reasoning mechanisms within the dataset empower the model to address a broader spectrum of mathematical problems, enhancing its adaptability as a generalist model. Additionally, MAmmoTH's capability to surpass existing open-source models illustrates its promise as an effective means to enhance mathematical reasoning in large language models.\n\n\\section{Weaknesses}\nHowever, one possible drawback of this approach is the demand for a substantial volume of data, which may restrict its application to smaller datasets or less resource-intensive models. Another concern is the dependence on a new instruction-tuning dataset, which may not generalize as effectively as more traditional datasets. Furthermore, the exploration of PoT & CoT ratios could be advantageous, as their interactions with various factors like data quality or model architecture may be complex.\n\n\\section{Improvement Suggestions}\nTo mitigate these limitations, it may prove beneficial to test MAmmoTH on smaller datasets or models requiring less computational power, providing insights into its generalization and applicability in a broader array of situations. Additionally, investigating the interplay of PoT & CoT ratios with other factors, such as data integrity or model structure, could yield a more detailed understanding and enhance MAmmoTH's performance. A thorough examination of MAmmoTH's effectiveness across a wider variety of mathematical problem-solving tasks could also yield valuable insights into its generalization potential.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nConsidering the results presented, MAmmoTH appears to be a promising avenue for enhancing mathematical reasoning capabilities in large language models. Its ability to excel beyond existing open-source models, notably in out-of-domain settings, indicates its potential applicability across various scenarios. Nonetheless, a deeper investigation into MAmmoTH's limitations, including those related to data quality and generalization abilities, is probably necessary for a comprehensive understanding of its strengths and weaknesses. Overall, MAmmoTH represents a significant advancement in the field, emphasizing the necessity of novel instruction-tuning datasets, hybrid CoT & PoT reasoning frameworks, and versatile models for addressing diverse mathematical challenges.\n\n$$\n$$",

It encompasses 2,294 real-world software engineering challenges sourced from GitHub issues and related pull requests, requiring language models to create patches for problems within Python codebases. The authors analyze various advanced language models using SWE-bench and observe that these models encounter difficulties in fixing problems, particularly beyond the most straightforward ones. Additionally, they fine-tune two models, SWE-Llama 7b and 13b, utilizing SWE-benchtrain, a fresh dataset containing 19,000 issue-PR pairs.

The benchmark is based on a substantial collection of software engineering problems derived from authentic GitHub issues and corresponding pull requests.\n3. The authors have successfully fine-tuned two language models on a new dataset, SWE-benchtrain, which includes 19,000 issue-PR pairs.\n4.

        "abstract": "Imagining the future trajectory is the key for robots to make sound planning and successfully reach their goals. Therefore, text-conditioned video prediction (TVP) is an essential task to facilitate general robot policy learning. To tackle this task and empower robots with the ability to foresee the future, we propose a sample and computation-efficient model, named Seer, by inflating the pretrained text-toimage (T2I) stable diffusion models along the temporal axis. We enhance the U-Net and language conditioning model by incorporating computation-efficient spatial-temporal attention. Furthermore, we introduce a novel Frame Sequential Text Decomposer module that dissects a sentence\u2019s global instruction into temporally aligned sub-instructions, ensuring precise integration into each frame of generation. Our framework allows us to effectively leverage the extensive prior knowledge embedded in pretrained T2I models across the frames. With the adaptable-designed architecture, Seer makes it possible to generate high-fidelity, coherent, and instruction-aligned video frames by fine-tuning a few layers on a small amount of data. The experimental results on Something Something V2 (SSv2), Bridgedata and EpicKitchens-100 datasets demonstrate our superior video prediction performance with around 480-GPU hours versus CogVideo with over 12,480-GPU hours: achieving the 31% FVD improvement compared to the current SOTA model on SSv2 and 83.7% average preference in the human evaluation.

Conv-LoRA integrates ultra-lightweight convolutional parameters into Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to inject image-related inductive biases into the plain ViT encoder, further reinforcing SAM's local prior assumption. The approach is simple, generic, and obtains promising results across multiple domains.\n\nStrengths:\n\n1. The proposed approach, Conv-LoRA, is simple and generic, making it a promising method for adapting SAM to various downstream segmentation applications.\n2. Conv-LoRA leverages the strengths of LoRA, a popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach, to inject image-related local prior knowledge into the ViT encoder.\n3.

The authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the limitations of SAM's pretraining in specialized domains and discuss potential ways to address these limitations.\n2. The approach could be further improved by incorporating additional techniques, such as multi-scale attention or spatial attention, to better capture high-level semantic information.\n3.

The authors present a two-step strategy, which includes establishing an algorithmic framework and examining federated LCBs under two distinct privacy requirements: silo-level local differential privacy and shuffle differential privacy. They demonstrate that their framework can achieve nearly \"optimal\" regret without relying on a trusted server, even when utilizing the shuffle model of differential privacy.\n\n$\\boxed{Strengths:}\n1. The authors have conducted a detailed analysis of existing algorithms, pinpointing three critical issues: privacy protection failures, inaccuracies in regret bounds, and unsupported communication costs.\n2. The framework proposed offers a thorough solution that encompasses an algorithmic structure, theoretical assurances, and empirical assessments.\n3. By employing differential privacy, the algorithm safeguards the privacy of individual users, even in the absence of a trusted server.\n\n$\\boxed{Weaknesses:}\n1. The paper presumes that the data in each silo consists of a sequence of distinct users, a condition that might not be applicable in real-world scenarios. This could restrict the applicability of the findings.\n2. The authors utilize a basic local randomizer, which might not provide adequate privacy amplification, particularly for small \u03b5 values.\n\n$\\boxed{Suggestions for Improvement:}\n1. Consider easing the condition of uniqueness in data for each silo to permit data reuse or aggregation.\n2. Investigate alternative local randomizers that might deliver superior privacy amplification, similar to those found in earlier amplify-and-publish method studies.\n\n$\\boxed{Recommendation:}\nAfter considering the exhaustive analysis, the detailed framework, and experimental results, I recommend that this paper be published as is.

        "abstract": "Pipeline parallelism is one of the key components for large-scale distributed training, yet its efficiency suffers from pipeline bubbles which were deemed inevitable. In this work, we introduce a scheduling strategy that, to our knowledge, is the first to successfully achieve zero pipeline bubbles under synchronous training semantics. The key idea behind this improvement is to split the backward computation into two parts, one that computes gradient for the input and another that computes for the parameters. Based on this idea, we handcraft novel pipeline schedules that significantly outperform the baseline methods. We further develop an algorithm that automatically finds an optimal schedule based on specific model configuration and memory limit. Additionally, to truly achieve zero bubble, we introduce a novel technique to bypass synchronizations during the optimizer step. Experimental evaluations show that our method outperforms the 1F1B schedule up to 15% in throughput under a similar memory limit. This number can be further pushed to 30% when the memory constraint is relaxed. We believe our results mark a major step forward in harnessing the true potential of pipeline parallelism.

Adversarial Training (AT) has emerged as a popular approach for protecting neural networks against such attacks. However, a key challenge of AT is robust overfitting, where the network\u2019s robust performance on test data deteriorates with further training, thus hindering generalization. Motivated by the concept of active forgetting in the brain, we introduce a novel learning paradigm called \u201cForget to Mitigate Overfitting (FOMO)\". FOMO alternates between the forgetting phase, which randomly forgets a subset of weights and regulates the model\u2019s information through weight reinitialization, and the relearning phase, which emphasizes learning generalizable features. Our experiments on benchmark datasets and adversarial attacks show that FOMO alleviates robust overfitting by significantly reducing the gap between the best and last robust test accuracy while improving the state-of-the-art robustness. Furthermore, FOMO provides a better trade-off between standard and robust accuracy, outperforming baseline adversarial methods.

Since the seminal works devoted to EBMs dating back to the noughties, there have been a lot of efficient methods which solve the generative modelling problem by means of energy potentials (unnormalized likelihood functions). In contrast, the realm of Optimal Transport (OT) and, in particular, neural OT solvers is much less explored and limited by few recent works (excluding WGAN-based approaches which utilize OT as a loss function and do not model OT maps themselves). In our work, we bridge the gap between EBMs and Entropy-regularized OT. We present a novel methodology which allows utilizing the recent developments and technical improvements of the former in order to enrich the latter. From the theoretical perspective, we prove generalization bounds for our technique. In practice, we validate its applicability in toy 2D and image domains. To showcase the scalability, we empower our method with a pre-trained StyleGAN and apply it to high-res AFHQ 512 \u00d7 512 unpaired I2I translation. For simplicity, we choose simple shortand long-run EBMs as a backbone of our Energy-guided Entropic OT approach, leaving the application of more sophisticated EBMs for future research.

        "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has witnessed great progress with various improvements in the self-training framework with pseudo labeling. The main challenge is how to distinguish high-quality pseudo labels against the confirmation bias. However, existing pseudo-label selection strategies are limited to pre-defined schemes or complex hand-crafted policies specially designed for classification, failing to achieve high-quality labels, fast convergence, and task versatility simultaneously. To these ends, we propose a Semi-supervised Reward framework (SemiReward) that predicts reward scores to evaluate and filter out high-quality pseudo labels, which is pluggable to mainstream SSL methods in wide task types and scenarios. To mitigate confirmation bias, SemiReward is trained online in two stages with a generator model and subsampling strategy. With classification and regression tasks on 13 standard SSL benchmarks across three modalities, extensive experiments verify that SemiReward achieves significant performance gains and faster convergence speeds upon Pseudo Label, FlexMatch, and Free/SoftMatch.

        "abstract": "Relying on prior knowledge accumulated from related tasks, meta-learning offers a powerful approach to learning a novel task from limited training data. Recent approaches parameterize the prior with a family of probability density functions or recurrent neural networks, whose parameters can be optimized by utilizing validation data from the observed tasks. While these approaches have appealing empirical performance, the expressiveness of their prior is relatively low, which limits the generalization and interpretation of meta-learning. Aiming at expressive yet meaningful priors, this contribution puts forth a novel prior representation model that leverages the notion of algorithm unrolling. The key idea is to unroll the proximal gradient descent steps, where learnable piecewise linear functions are developed to approximate the desired proximal operators within tight theoretical error bounds established for both smooth and non-smooth proximal functions. The resultant multi-block neural network not only broadens the scope of learnable priors, but also enhances interpretability from an optimization viewpoint. Numerical tests conducted on few-shot learning datasets demonstrate markedly improved performance with flexible, visualizable, and understandable priors.",

Our system incorporates several key components, including a Finite Element Method (FEM)-based soft body model for simulating the sensing elastomer, a multi-material simulator for modeling diverse object types (such as elastic, elastoplastic, cables) under manipulation, a penalty-based contact model for handling contact dynamics. The differentiable nature of our system facilitates gradient-based optimization for both 1) refining physical properties in simulation using real-world data, hence narrowing the sim-to-real gap and 2) efficient learning of tactile-assisted grasping and contact-rich manipulation skills.

However, recent progress on multi-order game-theoretic interaction within deep neural networks (DNNs) reveals the representation bottleneck of modern ConvNets, where the expressive interactions have not been effectively encoded with the increased kernel size. To tackle this challenge, we propose a new family of modern ConvNets, dubbed MogaNet, for discriminative visual representation learning in pure ConvNet-based models with favorable complexity-performance trade-offs. MogaNet encapsulates conceptually simple yet effective convolutions and gated aggregation into a compact module, where discriminative features are efficiently gathered and contextualized adaptively. MogaNet exhibits great scalability, impressive efficiency of parameters, and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art ViTs and ConvNets on ImageNet and various downstream vision benchmarks, including COCO object detection, ADE20K semantic segmentation, 2D&3D human pose estimation, and video prediction. Notably, MogaNet hits 80.0% and 87.8% accuracy with 5.2M and 181M parameters on ImageNet-1K, outperforming ParC-Net and ConvNeXtL, while saving 59% FLOPs and 17M parameters, respectively.

        "peer_review_with_watermark": "$$$ \nPaper Summary: \nThis study introduces an acoustic music understanding model termed MERT, which employs Large-scale Self-Supervised Training. MERT integrates two teacher models: one focusing on acoustics using Residual Vector Quantisation Variational AutoEncoder (RVQ-VAE) and the other on music with ConstantQ Transform (CQT). Evaluated across 14 music understanding tasks, MERT achieves leading performance overall. The approach is scalable, reaching up to 330M parameters by utilizing various pre-training methods to mitigate training instability challenges.\n\nStrengths: \n1. MERT's evaluation across 14 music understanding tasks allows for a thorough assessment of its effectiveness.\n2. The combination of RVQ-VAE and CQT as teacher models effectively incorporates necessary acoustic and musical elements for MLM-based pre-training in music comprehension.\n3. The architecture\u2019s scalability to 330M parameters, leveraging diverse pre-training strategies, helps to resolve instability during training.\n\nWeaknesses: \n1. MERT\u2019s reliance on a brief 5-second training context may hinder its ability to grasp longer musical phrases.\n2. The observed training instabilities in larger models could stem from insufficient pre-training techniques.\n3. The RVQ-VAE's memory and computational demands might pose limitations.\n\nSuggestions for Improvement: \n1. Extend MERT's training to encompass longer audio recordings to overcome the limitation of the short 5-second context.\n2. Investigate different pre-training approaches to rectify training instability in larger models.\n3. Evaluate alternative teacher models that are more resource-efficient in terms of memory and computation.\n\nRecommendation: \nMERT represents a novel method for pre-training acoustic music understanding models through large-scale self-supervised learning. Despite its challenges, its advantages make it appealing for researchers and practitioners aiming to enhance music understanding capabilities. To bolster MERT further, we suggest training it on longer audio sequences to tackle the context limitation and exploring different pre-training strategies to resolve training instability in larger models. Additionally, looking into more efficient teacher models regarding memory and computational resources could prove advantageous. Overall, MERT significantly contributes to the domain of music information retrieval, with its weaknesses being solvable through the refinement of the pre-training framework and the exploration of alternative models and strategies. \n\n$$$",

A key challenge, supported both theoretically and empirically, is that robustness demands greater network capacity and more data than standard training. However, effectively adding capacity under stringent Lipschitz constraints has proven more difficult than it may seem, evident by the fact that state-of-the-art approach tend more towards underfitting than overfitting. Moreover, we posit that a lack of careful exploration of the design space for Lipshitz-based approaches has left potential performance gains on the table. In this work, we provide a more comprehensive evaluation to better uncover the potential of Lipschitz-based certification methods. Using a combination of novel techniques, design optimizations, and synthesis of prior work, we are able to significantly improve the state-of-the-art VRA for deterministic certification on a variety of benchmark datasets, and over a range of perturbation sizes. Of particular note, we discover that the addition of large \u201cCholesky-orthogonalized residual dense\u201d layers to the end of existing state-of-the-art Lipschitz-controlled ResNet architectures is especially effective for increasing network capacity and performance.

        "abstract": "Designing effective positional encodings for graphs is key to building powerful graph transformers and enhancing message-passing graph neural networks. Although widespread, using Laplacian eigenvectors as positional encodings faces two fundamental challenges: (1) Non-uniqueness: there are many different eigendecompositions of the same Laplacian, and (2) Instability: small perturbations to the Laplacian could result in completely different eigenspaces, leading to unpredictable changes in positional encoding. Despite many attempts to address nonuniqueness, most methods overlook stability, leading to poor generalization on unseen graph structures. We identify the cause of instability to be a \u201chard partition\u201d of eigenspaces. Hence, we introduce Stable and Expressive Positional Encodings (SPE), an architecture for processing eigenvectors that uses eigenvalues to \u201csoftly partition\u201d eigenspaces. SPE is the first architecture that is (1) provably stable, and (2) universally expressive for basis invariant functions whilst respecting all symmetries of eigenvectors. Besides guaranteed stability, we prove that SPE is at least as expressive as existing methods, and highly capable of counting graph structures. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our method on molecular property prediction, and out-of-distribution generalization tasks, finding improved generalization compared to existing positional encoding methods.",

        "abstract": "The application of machine learning (ML) in a range of geospatial tasks is increasingly common but often relies on globally available covariates such as satellite imagery that can either be expensive or lack predictive power. Here we explore the question of whether the vast amounts of knowledge found in Internet language corpora, now compressed within large language models (LLMs), can be leveraged for geospatial prediction tasks. We first demonstrate that LLMs embed remarkable spatial information about locations, but naively querying LLMs using geographic coordinates alone is ineffective in predicting key indicators like population density. We then present GeoLLM, a novel method that can effectively extract geospatial knowledge from LLMs with auxiliary map data from OpenStreetMap. We demonstrate the utility of our approach across multiple tasks of central interest to the international community, including the measurement of population density and economic livelihoods. Across these tasks, our method demonstrates a 70% improvement in performance (measured using Pearson\u2019s r) relative to baselines that use nearest neighbors or use information directly from the prompt, and performance equal to or exceeding satellite-based benchmarks in the literature. With GeoLLM, we observe that GPT-3.5 outperforms Llama 2 and RoBERTa by 19% and 51% respectively, suggesting that the performance of our method scales well with the size of the model and its pretraining dataset. Our experiments reveal that LLMs are remarkably sample-efficient, rich in geospatial information, and robust across the globe. Crucially, GeoLLM shows promise in mitigating the limitations of existing geospatial covariates and complementing them well.

        "abstract": "Bandwidth constraints during signal acquisition frequently impede real-time detection applications. Hyperspectral data is a notable example, whose vast volume compromises real-time hyperspectral detection. To tackle this hurdle, we introduce a novel approach leveraging pre-acquisition modulation to reduce the acquisition volume. This modulation process is governed by a deep learning model, utilizing prior information. Central to our approach is LUM-ViT, a Vision Transformer variant. Uniquely, LUM-ViT incorporates a learnable under-sampling mask tailored for pre-acquisition modulation. To further optimize for optical calculations, we propose a kernel-level weight binarization technique and a threestage fine-tuning strategy. Our evaluations reveal that, by sampling a mere 10% of the original image pixels, LUM-ViT maintains the accuracy loss within 1.8% on the ImageNet classification task. The method sustains near-original accuracy when implemented on real-world optical hardware, demonstrating its practicality. Code will be available at https://github.com/MaxLLF/LUM-ViT.",

        "title": "CURRICULUM REINFORCEMENT LEARNING FOR QUANTUM ARCHITECTURE SEARCH UNDER HARD-",
        "abstract": "The key challenge in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era is finding useful circuits compatible with current device limitations. Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) offer a potential solution by fixing the circuit architecture and optimizing individual gate parameters in an external loop. However, parameter optimization can become intractable, and the overall performance of the algorithm depends heavily on the initially chosen circuit architecture. Several quantum architecture search (QAS) algorithms have been developed to design useful circuit architectures automatically. In the case of parameter optimization alone, noise effects have been observed to dramatically influence the performance of the optimizer and final outcomes, which is a key line of study. However, the effects of noise on the architecture search, which could be just as critical, are poorly understood. This work addresses this gap by introducing a curriculum-based reinforcement learning QAS (CRLQAS) algorithm designed to tackle challenges in realistic VQA deployment. The algorithm incorporates (i) a 3D architecture encoding and restrictions on environment dynamics to explore the search space of possible circuits efficiently, (ii) an episode halting scheme to steer the agent to find shorter circuits, and (iii) a novel variant of simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation as an optimizer for faster convergence. To facilitate studies, we developed an optimized simulator for our algorithm, significantly improving computational efficiency in simulating noisy quantum circuits by employing the Pauli-transfer matrix formalism in the Pauli-Liouville basis. Numerical experiments focusing on quantum chemistry tasks demonstrate that CRLQAS outperforms existing QAS algorithms across several metrics in both noiseless and noisy environments.",

CRLQAS utilizes a three-dimensional architecture encoding, illegal action handling, random halting, and an innovative variant of the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation algorithm to minimize energy function evaluations amid noise. In the area of quantum architecture search (QAS), the algorithm achieves state-of-the-art results by determining the ground-state energy within the bounds of chemical accuracy while recommending circuits with low gate counts and depths.\n\nStrengths: \n1. The CRLQAS algorithm adeptly confronts the specific challenges that arise when deploying VQE in authentic noisy quantum environments by implementing a curriculum-based learning strategy, which allows the agent to adapt dynamically to varying problem difficulties.\n2. By including illegal actions, random halting, and a novel version of the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation algorithm, the algorithm's efficiency and resilience are significantly improved.\n3. The notable six-fold acceleration gained through the use of the Pauli-transfer matrix (PTM) framework in the Pauli-Liouville basis enhances the feasibility of simulating actual noisy quantum circuits, thereby increasing the algorithm's relevance to real-world quantum hardware.\n\nWeaknesses: \n1. There may be a considerable requirement for hyperparameter tuning, as the selections of nact, p, nfail, and the threshold value \u03be can affect the CRLQAS algorithm's performance.\n2. The tests performed on the LiH\u22126 molecule did not accomplish chemical accuracy, indicating a need for further exploration of the algorithm's robustness in conditions of substantial noise.\n3. The limited comparative evaluation between CRLQAS and the QCAS method showed that the QCAS algorithm did not achieve chemical accuracy for the LiH\u22126 molecule while CRLQAS showed notable improvements on the same task.\n\nSuggestions for Improvement: \n1. Implement comprehensive hyperparameter tuning to enhance the CRLQAS algorithm's performance, guaranteeing its robustness across different quantum noise scenarios.\n2. Explore the CRLQAS algorithm's resilience in the presence of significant noise, as seen with the LiH\u22126 molecule, possibly by utilizing additional noise models or robust optimization techniques.\n3. Carry out comparative studies between CRLQAS and other existing QAS algorithms, like quantumDARTS, qubit-ADAPT-VQE, and QCAS, to demonstrate CRLQAS's advantages across multiple quantum chemistry tasks.\n\nRecommendation: \nThis paper illustrates the CRLQAS algorithm's effectiveness in overcoming the complexities associated with deploying VQE in realistic noisy quantum environments, achieving leading performance in the QAS sub-field. Nonetheless, further research into the algorithm\u2019s robustness, hyperparameter tuning, and comparative evaluations with existing QAS algorithms is essential for realizing the full capabilities of CRLQAS. \n\nThe authors' capability to address the distinctive challenges of deploying VQE in authentic noisy quantum settings, along with the inclusion of illegal actions, random halting, and a new variant of the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation algorithm, along with the remarkable six-fold speed-up made possible through the PTM framework, renders CRLQAS a compelling option for real-world quantum hardware.\n\nHowever, the lack of chemical accuracy in the experiments conducted on the LiH\u22126 molecule points to the requirement for additional inquiry into the algorithm\u2019s robustness under severe noise conditions, as well as the necessity for thorough hyperparameter tuning to optimize the performance of the CRLQAS algorithm.\n\nEnd of Review: \n\n$$",

        "title": "GIM: LEARNING GENERALIZABLE IMAGE MATCHER",
        "abstract": "Image matching is a fundamental computer vision problem. While learning-based methods achieve state-of-the-art performance on existing benchmarks, they generalize poorly to in-the-wild images. Such methods typically need to train separate models for different scene types (e.g., indoor vs. outdoor) and are impractical when the scene type is unknown in advance. One of the underlying problems is the limited scalability of existing data construction pipelines, which limits the diversity of standard image matching datasets. To address this problem, we propose GIM, a self-training framework for learning a single generalizable model based on any image matching architecture using internet videos, an abundant and diverse data source. Given an architecture, GIM first trains it on standard domain-specific datasets and then combines it with complementary matching methods to create dense labels on nearby frames of novel videos. These labels are filtered by robust fitting, and then enhanced by propagating them to distant frames. The final model is trained on propagated data with strong augmentations. Not relying on complex 3D reconstruction makes GIM much more efficient and less likely to fail than standard SfM-and-MVS based frameworks. We also propose ZEB, the first zero-shot evaluation benchmark for image matching. By mixing data from diverse domains, ZEB can thoroughly assess the cross-domain generalization performance of different methods. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of GIM. Applying GIM consistently improves the zero-shot performance of 3 state-of-theart image matching architectures as the number of downloaded videos increases (Fig. 1 (a)); with 50 hours of YouTube videos, the relative zero-shot performance improves by 8.4% \u2212 18.1%. GIM also enables generalization to extreme crossdomain data such as Bird Eye View (BEV) images of projected 3D point clouds (Fig. 1 (c)). More importantly, our single zero-shot model consistently outperforms domain-specific baselines when evaluated on downstream tasks inherent to their respective domains. The code will be released upon acceptance.",

        "abstract": "This work presents an information-theoretic perspective to group fairness trade-offs in federated learning (FL) with respect to sensitive attributes, such as gender, race, etc. Existing works often focus on either global fairness (overall disparity of the model across all clients) or local fairness (disparity of the model at each client), without always considering their trade-offs. There is a lack of understanding of the interplay between global and local fairness in FL, particularly under data heterogeneity, and if and when one implies the other. To address this gap, we leverage a body of work in information theory called partial information decomposition (PID), which first identifies three sources of unfairness in FL, namely, Unique Disparity, Redundant Disparity, and Masked Disparity. We demonstrate how these three disparities contribute to global and local fairness using canonical examples. This decomposition helps us derive fundamental limits on the trade-off between global and local fairness, highlighting where they agree or disagree. We introduce the Accuracy & Global-Local Fairness Optimality Problem (AGLFOP), a convex optimization that defines the theoretical limits of accuracy and fairness trade-offs, identifying the best possible performance any FL strategy can attain given a dataset and client distribution. We also present experimental results on synthetic datasets and the ADULT dataset to support our theoretical findings.",

        "abstract": "Characterizing samples that are difficult to learn from is crucial to developing highly performant ML models. This has led to numerous Hardness Characterization Methods (HCMs) that aim to identify \u201chard\u201d samples. However, there is a lack of consensus regarding the definition and evaluation of \u201chardness\u201d. Unfortunately, current HCMs have only been evaluated on specific types of hardness and often only qualitatively or with respect to downstream performance, overlooking the fundamental quantitative identification task. We address this gap by presenting a fine-grained taxonomy of hardness types. Additionally, we propose the Hardness Characterization Analysis Toolkit (H-CAT), which supports comprehensive and quantitative benchmarking of HCMs across the hardness taxonomy and can easily be extended to new HCMs, hardness types, and datasets. We use H-CAT to evaluate 13 different HCMs across 8 hardness types. This comprehensive evaluation encompassing over 14K setups uncovers strengths and weaknesses of different HCMs, leading to practical tips to guide HCM selection and future development. Our findings highlight the need for more comprehensive HCM evaluation, while we hope our hardness taxonomy and toolkit will advance the principled evaluation and uptake of data-centric AI methods.",

The taxonomy of hardness types may not be exhaustive, and there may be other types of hardness that are not considered.\n3. The authors may have overemphasized the importance of learning dynamics-based methods, which may not be the case for all applications.\n4.

        "abstract": "Grounding the abstract knowledge captured by Large Language Models (LLMs) in physical domains remains a pivotal yet unsolved problem. Whereas prior works have largely focused on leveraging LLMs for generating abstract plans in symbolic spaces, this work uses LLMs to guide the learning for structures and constraints in robot manipulation tasks. Specifically, we borrow from manipulation planning literature the concept of mode families, defining specific types of motion constraints among sets of objects, to serve as an intermediate layer that connects high-level language representations with low-level physical trajectories. By locally perturbing a small set of successful human demonstrations, we augment the dataset with additional successful executions as well as counterfactuals that fail the task. Our explanation-based learning framework trains neural network-based classifiers to differentiate success task executions from failures and as a by-product learns classifiers that ground low-level states into mode families without dense labeling. This further enables us to learn structured policies for the target task. Experimental validation in both 2D continuous-space and robotic manipulation environments demonstrates the robustness of our mode-based imitation methods under external perturbations.",

        "title": "IMPROVING EQUILIBRIUM PROPAGATION WITHOUT WEIGHT SYMMETRY THROUGH JACOBIAN HOMEOSTASIS",
        "abstract": "Equilibrium propagation (EP) is a compelling alternative to the backpropagation of error algorithm (BP) for computing gradients of neural networks on biological or analog neuromorphic substrates. Still, the algorithm requires weight symmetry and infinitesimal equilibrium perturbations, i.e., nudges, to yield unbiased gradient estimates. Both requirements are challenging to implement in physical systems. Yet, whether and how weight asymmetry contributes to bias is unknown because, in practice, its contribution may be masked by a finite nudge. To address this question, we study generalized EP, which can be formulated without weight symmetry, and analytically isolate the two sources of bias. For complex-differentiable non-symmetric networks, we show that bias due to finite nudge can be avoided by estimating exact derivatives via a Cauchy integral. In contrast, weight asymmetry induces residual bias through poor alignment of EP\u2019s neuronal error vectors compared to BP resulting in low task performance. To mitigate the latter issue, we present a new homeostatic objective that directly penalizes functional asymmetries of the Jacobian at the network\u2019s fixed point. This homeostatic objective dramatically improves the network\u2019s ability to solve complex tasks such as ImageNet 32\u00d732. Our results lay the theoretical groundwork for studying and mitigating the adverse effects of imperfections of physical networks on learning algorithms that rely on the substrate\u2019s relaxation dynamics.",

        "title": "GUESS & SKETCH: LANGUAGE MODEL GUIDED TRANSPILATION",
        "abstract": "Maintaining legacy software requires many software and systems engineering hours. Assembly code programs, which demand low-level control over the computer machine state and have no variable names, are particularly difficult for humans to analyze. Existing conventional program translators guarantee correctness, but are hand-engineered for the source and target programming languages in question. Learned transpilation, i.e. automatic translation of code, offers an alternative to manual re-writing and engineering efforts. Automated symbolic program translation approaches guarantee correctness but struggle to scale to longer programs due to the exponentially large search space. Their rigid rule-based systems also limit their expressivity, so they can only reason about a reduced space of programs. Probabilistic neural language models (LMs) produce plausible outputs for every input, but do so at the cost of guaranteed correctness. In this work, we leverage the strengths of LMs and symbolic solvers in a neurosymbolic approach to learned transpilation for assembly code. Assembly code is an appropriate setting for a neurosymbolic approach, since assembly code can be divided into shorter non-branching basic blocks amenable to the use of symbolic methods. GUESS & SKETCH extracts alignment and confidence information from features of the LM then passes it to a symbolic solver to resolve semantic equivalence of the transpilation input and output. We test GUESS & SKETCH on three different test sets of assembly transpilation tasks, varying in difficulty, and show that it successfully transpiles 57.6% more examples than GPT-4 and 39.6% more examples than an engineered transpiler. We also share a training and evaluation dataset for this task.",

        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a standard approach for fine-tuning large language models to follow instructions. As part of this process, learned reward models are used to approximately model human preferences. However, as imperfect representations of the \u201ctrue\u201d reward, these learned reward models are susceptible to overoptimization. Gao et al. (2023) studied this phenomenon in a synthetic human feedback setup with a significantly larger \u201cgold\u201d reward model acting as the true reward (instead of humans) and showed that overoptimization remains a persistent problem regardless of the size of the proxy reward model and training data used. Using a similar setup, we conduct a systematic study to evaluate the efficacy of using ensemble-based conservative optimization objectives, specifically worst-case optimization (WCO) and uncertainty-weighted optimization (UWO), for mitigating reward model overoptimization when using two optimization methods: (a) best-of-n sampling (BoN) (b) proximal policy optimization (PPO). We additionally extend the setup of Gao et al. (2023) to include 25% label noise to better mirror real-world conditions. Both with and without label noise, we find that conservative optimization practically eliminates overoptimization and improves performance by up to 70% for BoN sampling. For PPO, ensemble-based conservative optimization always reduces overoptimization and outperforms single reward model optimization. Moreover, combining it with a small KL penalty successfully prevents overoptimization at no performance cost. Overall, our results demonstrate that ensemble-based conservative optimization can effectively counter overoptimization.",

Although several preventive measures have been developed to mitigate the potential risks associated with LLMs, they have primarily focused on English. In this study, we reveal the presence of multilingual jailbreak challenges within LLMs and consider two potential risky scenarios: unintentional and intentional. The unintentional scenario involves users querying LLMs using non-English prompts and inadvertently bypassing the safety mechanisms, while the intentional scenario concerns malicious users combining malicious instructions with multilingual prompts to deliberately attack LLMs. The experimental results reveal that in the unintentional scenario, the rate of unsafe content increases as the availability of languages decreases. Specifically, low-resource languages exhibit about three times the likelihood of encountering harmful content compared to high-resource languages, with both ChatGPT and GPT-4. In the intentional scenario, multilingual prompts can exacerbate the negative impact of malicious instructions, with astonishingly high rates of unsafe output: 80.92% for ChatGPT and 40.71% for GPT-4. To handle such a challenge in the multilingual context, we propose a novel SELF-DEFENSE framework that automatically generates multilingual training data for safety fine-tuning. Experimental results show that ChatGPT fine-tuned with such data can achieve a substantial reduction in unsafe content generation.

        "abstract": "In theoretical neuroscience, recent work leverages deep learning tools to explore how some network attributes critically influence its learning dynamics. Notably, initial weight distributions with small (resp. large) variance may yield a rich (resp. lazy) regime, where significant (resp. minor) changes to network states and representation are observed over the course of learning. However, in biology, neural circuit connectivity could exhibit a low-rank structure and therefore differs markedly from the random initializations generally used for these studies. As such, here we investigate how the structure of the initial weights \u2014 in particular their effective rank \u2014 influences the network learning regime. Through both empirical and theoretical analyses, we discover that high-rank initializations typically yield smaller network changes indicative of lazier learning, a finding we also confirm with experimentally-driven initial connectivity in recurrent neural networks. Conversely, low-rank initialization biases learning towards richer learning. Importantly, however, as an exception to this rule, we find lazier learning can still occur with a low-rank initialization that aligns with task and data statistics. Our research highlights the pivotal role of initial weight structures in shaping learning regimes, with implications for metabolic costs of plasticity and risks of catastrophic forgetting.",

        "abstract": "Alignment with human preference is a desired property of large language models (LLMs). Currently, the main alignment approach is based on reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Despite the effectiveness of RLHF, it is intricate to implement and train, thus recent studies explore how to develop alternative alignment approaches based on supervised fine-tuning (SFT). A major limitation of SFT is that it essentially does imitation learning, which cannot fully understand what are the expected behaviors. To address this issue, we propose an improved alignment approach named FIGA. Different from prior methods, we incorporate fine-grained (i.e., token or phrase level) quality signals that are derived by contrasting good and bad responses. Our approach has made two major contributions. Firstly, we curate a refined alignment dataset that pairs initial responses and the corresponding revised ones. Secondly, we devise a new loss function can leverage fine-grained quality signals to instruct the learning of LLMs for alignment. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approaches by comparing a number of competitive baselines.

        "abstract": "Online-Within-Online (OWO) meta learning stands for the online multi-task learning paradigm in which both tasks and data within each task become available in a sequential order. In this work, we study the OWO meta learning of the initialization and step size of within-task online algorithms in the non-convex setting, and provide improved regret bounds under mild assumptions of loss functions. Previous work analyzing this scenario has obtained for bounded and piecewise Lipschitz functions an averaged regret bound O(( \u221a m T 1/4 + (logm) log T \u221a T + V ) \u221a m) across T tasks, with m iterations per task and V the task similarity. Our first contribution is to modify the existing non-convex OWO meta learning algorithm and improve the regret bound to O(( 1 T 1/2\u2212\u03b1 + (log T ) 9/2 T + V ) \u221a m), for any \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1/2). The derived bound has a faster convergence rate with respect to T , and guarantees a vanishing task-averaged regret with respect to m (for any fixed T ). Then, we propose a new algorithm of regret O(( log T T + V ) \u221a m) for non-convex OWO meta learning. This regret bound exhibits a better asymptotic performance than previous ones, and holds for any bounded (not necessarily Lipschitz) loss functions. Besides the improved regret bounds, our contributions include investigating how to attain generalization bounds for statistical meta learning via regret analysis. Specifically, by online-to-batch arguments, we achieve a transfer risk bound for batch meta learning that assumes all tasks are drawn from a distribution. Moreover, by connecting multi-task generalization error with taskaveraged regret, we develop for statistical multi-task learning a novel PAC-Bayes generalization error bound that involves our regret bound for OWO meta learning.",

Existing methods primarily treat layout generation as a numerical optimization task, focusing on quantitative aspects while overlooking the semantic information of layout, such as the relationship between each layout element. In this paper, we propose LayoutNUWA, the first model that treats layout generation as a code generation task to enhance semantic information and harnesses the hidden layout expertise of large language models (LLMs).

        "title": "ERAL GEOMETRY FOR KNOWLEDGE DISTILLATION",
        "abstract": "Knowledge distillation aims to train a compact student network using soft supervision from a larger teacher network and hard supervision from ground truths. However, determining an optimal knowledge fusion ratio that balances these supervisory signals remains challenging. Prior methods generally resort to a constant or heuristic-based fusion ratio, which often falls short of a proper balance. In this study, we introduce a novel adaptive method for learning a sample-wise knowledge fusion ratio, exploiting both the correctness of teacher and student, as well as how well the student mimics the teacher on each sample. Our method naturally leads to the intra-sample trilateral geometric relations among the student prediction (S), teacher prediction (T ), and ground truth (G). To counterbalance the impact of outliers, we further extend to the inter-sample relations, incorporating the teacher\u2019s global average prediction (T\u0304 ) for samples within the same class. A simple neural network then learns the implicit mapping from the intraand inter-sample relations to an adaptive, sample-wise knowledge fusion ratio in a bilevel-optimization manner. Our approach provides a simple, practical, and adaptable solution for knowledge distillation that can be employed across various architectures and model sizes. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent improvements over other loss re-weighting methods on image classification, attack detection, and click-through rate prediction.",

Drawing inspiration from masked language models, contemporary self-supervised strategies focus on predicting masked areas using visible content from images. The masked autoencoding technique has proven effective, achieving leading performance in image recognition tasks. Nevertheless, utilizing regions can offer a more relevant visual counterpart to words, as they reflect spatial relationships and organize pixels into coherent groups.

Leveraging regions from SAM, which is a universal region proposal model, significantly enhances performance across all tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of high-quality regions.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n1.

Enhance the SAM model by creating a more efficient and budget-friendly strategy for generating high-quality regions that could elevate the performance of R-MAE.\n2.  Investigate methods to integrate more intricate visual relationships, potentially through the inclusion of spatial hierarchies, graph-based models, or visual frameworks from pre-trained models such as ViT-B.\n3.  Develop a straightforward, approachable, and user-friendly interactive segmentation system that utilizes pre-trained models like R-MAE, showcasing the practical applications of visual analogue learning.\n\nRecommendation:\n\nGiven the experimental findings, I strongly recommend the incorporation of regions from SAM, a universal model for generating region proposals, to enhance R-MAE\u2019s effectiveness across all tasks, including detection, segmentation, and instance segmentation.

        "abstract": "Graph-based semi-supervised learning, particularly in the context of extremely sparse labeled data, often suffers from degenerate solutions where label functions tend to be nearly constant across unlabeled data. In this paper, we introduce Variance-enlarged Poisson Learning (VPL), a simple yet powerful framework tailored to alleviate the issues arising from the presence of degenerate solutions. VPL incorporates a variance-enlarged regularization term, which induces a Poisson equation specifically for unlabeled data. This intuitive approach increases the dispersion of labels from their average mean, effectively reducing the likelihood of degenerate solutions characterized by nearly constant label functions. We subsequently introduce two streamlined algorithms, V-Laplace and V-Poisson, each intricately designed to enhance Laplace and Poisson learning, respectively. Furthermore, we broaden the scope of VPL to encompass graph neural networks, introducing Variance-enlarged Graph Poisson Networks (V-GPN) to facilitate improved label propagation. To achieve a deeper understanding of VPL\u2019s behavior, we conduct a comprehensive theoretical exploration in both discrete and variational cases. Our findings elucidate that VPL inherently amplifies the importance of connections within the same class while concurrently tempering those between different classes.

        "abstract": "Previous literature on policy diversity in reinforcement learning (RL) either focuses on the online setting or ignores the policy performance. In contrast, offline RL, which aims to learn high-quality policies from batched data, has yet to fully leverage the intrinsic diversity of the offline dataset. Addressing this dichotomy and aiming to balance quality and diversity poses a significant challenge to extant methodologies. This paper introduces a novel approach, termed Stylized Offline RL (SORL), which is designed to extract high-performing, stylistically diverse policies from a dataset characterized by distinct behavioral patterns. Drawing inspiration from the venerable Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, SORL innovatively alternates between policy learning and trajectory clustering, a mechanism that promotes policy diversification. To further augment policy performance, we introduce advantage-weighted style learning into the SORL framework. Experimental evaluations across multiple environments demonstrate the significant superiority of SORL over previous methods in extracting high-quality policies with diverse behaviors. A case in point is that SORL successfully learns strong policies with markedly distinct playing patterns from a real-world human dataset of a popular basketball video game \u201dDunk City Dynasty.\u201d",

This method constructs a smoothed DNN model and certifies its robustness through statistical sampling, but it is computationally expensive, especially when certifying with a large number of samples.

We present the first approach for incremental robustness certification for randomized smoothing, IRS. We show how to reuse the certification guarantees for the original smoothed model to certify an approximated model with very few samples.

        "abstract": "The fluency and creativity of large pre-trained language models (LLMs) have led to their widespread use, sometimes even as a replacement for traditional search engines. Yet language models are prone to making convincing but factually inaccurate claims, often referred to as \u2018hallucinations.\u2019 These errors can inadvertently spread misinformation or harmfully perpetuate misconceptions. Further, manual fact-checking of model responses is a time-consuming process, making human factuality labels expensive to acquire. In this work, we fine-tune language models to be more factual, without human labeling and targeting more open-ended generation settings than past work. We leverage two key recent innovations in NLP to do so. First, several recent works have proposed methods for judging the factuality of open-ended text by measuring consistency with an external knowledge base or simply a large model\u2019s confidence scores. Second, the direct preference optimization algorithm enables straightforward fine-tuning of language models on objectives other than supervised imitation, using a preference ranking over possible model responses. We show that learning from automatically generated factuality preference rankings, generated either through existing retrieval systems or our novel retrieval-free approach, significantly improves the factuality (percent of generated claims that are correct) of Llama-2 on held-out topics compared with RLHF or decoding strategies targeted at factuality. At 7B scale, compared to Llama-2-chat, we observe 58% and 40% reduction in factual error rate when generating biographies and answering medical questions, respectively.",

The datasets used for evaluation are limited, and it is uncertain how well the method would fare on other datasets.\n5. The paper lacks a comprehensive discussion on possible biases associated with the reference-based approach.\n\nSuggestions for Enhancement:\n1. Consider expanding the method to additional tasks, including text classification and sentiment analysis.\n2.

Many such approaches, however, lack formal guarantees establishing the precise relationship between the model and the extracted rules, and this lack of assurance becomes especially problematic when the extracted rules are applied in safetycritical contexts or to ensure compliance with legal requirements. Recent research has examined whether the rules derived from the influential NEURAL-LP model exhibit soundness (or completeness), which means that the results obtained by applying the model to any dataset always contain (or are contained in) the results obtained by applying the rules to the same dataset. In this paper, we extend this analysis to the context of DRUM, an approach that has demonstrated superior practical performance. After observing that the rules currently extracted from a DRUM model can be unsound and/or incomplete, we propose a novel algorithm where the output rules, expressed in an extension of Datalog, ensure both soundness and completeness. This algorithm, however, can be inefficient in practice and hence we propose additional constraints to DRUM models facilitating rule extraction, albeit at the expense of reduced expressive power.",

One of its key components is the MaxEnt Model Correction (MoCo) procedure that corrects the model\u2019s next-state distributions based on a Maximum Entropy density estimation formulation. Based on MoCo, we introduce the Model Correcting Value Iteration (MoCoVI) algorithm, and its sampled-based variant MoCoDyna. We show that MoCoVI and MoCoDyna\u2019s convergence can be much faster than the conventional model-free algorithms.

        "peer_review_with_watermark": "$$$\\\\\n\nPaper Summary:\nThis paper introduces an affordable method to mitigate model errors in reinforcement learning (RL). The authors put forward the MaxEnt model correction framework, which utilizes maximum entropy density estimation to minimize model inaccuracies with a limited number of inquiries into the actual dynamics. This framework is applicable to both policy evaluation and control, demonstrating a considerable increase in convergence rates and the ability to converge to the correct value functions despite small model errors. Additionally, a sample-based version named MoCoDyna is presented, which builds upon the Dyna framework. The authors validate their method through numerical experiments, contrasting it with other RL algorithms, and highlighting its superior convergence rates and expected returns.\n\nStrengths:\n1. The paper offers a concise and organized explanation of essential concepts and methods, including definitions of model error, maximum entropy density estimation, and the MaxEnt model correction framework.\n2. The authors conduct a detailed theoretical analysis of the framework, covering convergence results and error limits, thereby laying a firm groundwork for its practical applications.\n3. The introduction of the MoCoDyna variant, which extends the Dyna framework, provides an alternative strategy for addressing model errors in RL.\n4. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated through numerical comparisons with other RL algorithms, showing advantages in convergence rates and expected returns.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. There is a lack of explicit discussion about hyperparameter selection, such as query numbers, basis functions, and learning rates\u2014factors that can be pivotal in practical applications.\n2. The paper falls short of detailing how the performance of MoCoVI and MoCoDyna changes with an increasing number of queries, information that could shed light on the balance between accuracy and computational demands.\n3. The framework's resilience to noise and uncertainty in real-world scenarios is not considered, an important factor for real-world implementations.\n4. There are no explicit results addressing how MoCoVI and MoCoDyna's performance declines with an increase in time steps, which would help evaluate the algorithms' long-term effectiveness.\n\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n1. The authors should clarify the selection of hyperparameters and analyze their impact on the algorithms' performance.\n2. They should also include results on how the performance of MoCoVI and MoCoDyna is affected as the number of queries grows, along with guidance on optimizing the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency.\n3. Addressing the framework's robustness to environmental noise and uncertainty would be beneficial, including presenting how the algorithms perform under such conditions.\n4. Finally, providing explicit results on performance degradation in MoCoVI and MoCoDyna related to increased time steps would enhance understanding of the algorithms' long-term behavior.\n\nRecommendation:\nThe paper outlines a cost-effective method for reducing model errors in RL and offers an in-depth theoretical framework analysis. The authors illustrate their method's efficacy through numerical experiments, comparing it favorably against other RL algorithms in terms of convergence rates and expected returns. While there are areas needing enhancement, such as a clear discussion on hyperparameters and robustness against noise and uncertainty, the work lays a strong foundation for practical applications of the MaxEnt model correction framework. If the authors refine their method and supply clearer performance metrics, this paper could achieve high quality upon revision and resubmission.\n\n$\n\\\\\n\nNote: The review is quite extensive; it would benefit from being divided into smaller sections or condensed overall. More concrete and specific comments regarding the paper\u2019s deficiencies and areas for improvement would also elevate the feedback.",

        "abstract": "Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) stands as a cornerstone optimization algorithm with proven real-world empirical successes but relatively limited theoretical understanding. Recent research has illuminated a key factor contributing to its practical efficacy: the implicit regularization it instigates. Several studies have investigated the linear stability property of SGD in the vicinity of a stationary point as a predictive proxy for sharpness and generalization error in overparameterized neural networks (Wu et al., 2022; Jastrzebski et al., 2019; Cohen et al., 2021). In this paper, we delve deeper into the relationship between linear stability and sharpness. More specifically, we meticulously delineate the necessary and sufficient conditions for linear stability, contingent on hyperparameters of SGD and the sharpness at the optimum. Towards this end, we introduce a novel coherence measure of the loss Hessian that encapsulates pertinent geometric properties of the loss function that are relevant to the linear stability of SGD. It enables us to provide a simplified sufficient condition for identifying linear instability at an optimum. Notably, compared to previous works, our analysis relies on significantly milder assumptions and is applicable for a broader class of loss functions than known before, encompassing not only mean-squared error but also cross-entropy loss.",
