        "abstract": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, UCL, London, United Kingdom Microsoft Research, Cambridge ABSTRACT Scientific discovery hinges on the effective integration of metadata, which refers to a set of conceptual operations such as determining what information is relevant for inquiry, and data, which encompasses physical operations such as observation and experimentation. This paper introduces the Causal Modelling Agent (CMA), a novel framework that synergizes the metadata-based reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the data-driven modelling of Deep Structural Causal Models (DSCMs) for the task of causal discovery. We evaluate the CMA\u2019s performance on a number of benchmarks, as well as on the real-world task of modelling the clinical and radiological phenotype of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD). Our experimental results indicate that the CMA can outperform previous purely data-driven or metadata-driven approaches to causal discovery. In our real-world application, we use the CMA to derive new insights into the causal relationships among biomarkers of AD.",

While there are areas for future improvements (as outlined above), its effectiveness on a variety of experimental datasets demonstrates its potential for real-world applications.\n\nThe proposed framework is well-structured and easy to understand; providing a clear description of its theoretical underpinning (Section 3) and practical implementation (Section 5). Experimental evaluations on diverse datasets (Section 5) provide valuable insights into its performance.\n\nThe main limitation of this study is its focus on DSCMs for causal discovery; which may limit its applicability to non-Markovian causal structures (feedback loops). Future studies should aim to extend this framework to address such scenarios.\n\nIn conclusion, this study contributes to the development of causal modelling methods for multi-modal data analysis; showcasing a promising combination of LLMs with DSCMs for causal discovery.\n\nAuthor's response is recommended for addressing some of the noted areas for future improvements.\n\nAuthor's response:\nThe response is expected to address areas such as non-Markovian causal structures (feedback loops) in DSCMs;

        "title": "LANGUAGE-INFORMED VISUAL CONCEPT LEARNING",
        "abstract": "Our understanding of the visual world is centered around various concept axes, characterizing different aspects of visual entities. While different concept axes can be easily specified by language, e.g., color, the exact visual nuances along each axis often exceed the limitations of linguistic articulations, e.g., a particular style of painting. In this work, our goal is to learn a language-informed visual concept representation, by simply distilling large pre-trained vision-language models. Specifically, we train a set of concept encoders to encode the information pertinent to a set of language-informed concept axes, with an objective of reproducing the input image through a pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) model. To encourage better disentanglement of different concept encoders, we anchor the concept embeddings to a set of text embeddings obtained from a pre-trained Visual Question Answering (VQA) model. At inference time, the model extracts concept embeddings along various axes from new test images, which can be remixed to generate images with novel compositions of visual concepts. With a lightweight test-time finetuning procedure, it can also generalize to novel concepts unseen at training. Project page at https://cs.stanford.edu/ \u0303yzzhang/projects/concept-axes.",

In practice, one might encounter explanations which lack informativeness or contradict visual-grounded facts, known as implausibility and hallucination problems, respectively. To tackle these challenging issues, we consider the task of visual question answering (VQA) and introduce Rapper, a two-stage Reinforced RationalePrompted Paradigm. By knowledge distillation, the former stage of Rapper infuses rationale-prompting via large language models (LLMs), encouraging the rationales supported by language-based facts. As for the latter stage, a unique Reinforcement Learning from NLE Feedback (RLNF) is introduced for injecting visual facts into NLE generation.
