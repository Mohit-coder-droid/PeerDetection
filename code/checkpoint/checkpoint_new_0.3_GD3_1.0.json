        "abstract": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, UCL, London, United Kingdom Microsoft Research, Cambridge ABSTRACT Scientific discovery hinges on the effective integration of metadata, which refers to a set of conceptual operations such as determining what information is relevant for inquiry, and data, which encompasses physical operations such as observation and experimentation. This paper introduces the Causal Modelling Agent (CMA), a novel framework that synergizes the metadata-based reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the data-driven modelling of Deep Structural Causal Models (DSCMs) for the task of causal discovery. We evaluate the CMA\u2019s performance on a number of benchmarks, as well as on the real-world task of modelling the clinical and radiological phenotype of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD). Our experimental results indicate that the CMA can outperform previous purely data-driven or metadata-driven approaches to causal discovery. In our real-world application, we use the CMA to derive new insights into the causal relationships among biomarkers of AD.",

The CMA framework merges the metadata-driven reasoning capabilities of LLMs with the data-focused modelling approach of DSCMs to identify causal connections among variables.\n\nStrengths:\n1. The CMA framework presents a novel and potentially impactful method for causal discovery in multi-modal datasets.\n2. The merging of LLM-based techniques with DSCMs creates a synergistic effect, harnessing the strengths of both approaches to enhance causal discovery.\n3. The framework has been shown to surpass existing metadata-driven and data-driven methods across certain benchmarks.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. The paper presumes a high level of familiarity with both LLMs and DSCMs, which might hinder non-experts from fully understanding the contributions and challenges presented.\n2. The experimental framework may not thoroughly tackle the complexities associated with multi-modal data, where variables can exhibit varying distributions or correlations across different modalities.\n3. The research could gain from further evaluation on datasets characterized by more intricate structures or greater dimensionality.\n\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n1. A more comprehensive review of relevant literature on causal discovery in multi-modal data could enhance the context surrounding the discussed contributions.\n2. Supplementary experimental evaluations on datasets with varied structures and dimensions would contribute to a more solid assessment of the CMA framework.\n3. An in-depth analysis of the challenges posed by multi-modal data and the ways in which the CMA framework addresses these issues would improve the paper's overall quality.\n\nRecommendation:\nGiven the discussed contributions, I recommend that the paper be accepted for publication in its existing form. However, I would like to see further experimental evaluations on a variety of datasets to ensure a more thorough assessment of the CMA framework.\n\nReviewer:\n[Your Name]",

        "abstract": "Our understanding of the visual world is centered around various concept axes, characterizing different aspects of visual entities. While different concept axes can be easily specified by language, e.g., color, the exact visual nuances along each axis often exceed the limitations of linguistic articulations, e.g., a particular style of painting. In this work, our goal is to learn a language-informed visual concept representation, by simply distilling large pre-trained vision-language models. Specifically, we train a set of concept encoders to encode the information pertinent to a set of language-informed concept axes, with an objective of reproducing the input image through a pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) model. To encourage better disentanglement of different concept encoders, we anchor the concept embeddings to a set of text embeddings obtained from a pre-trained Visual Question Answering (VQA) model. At inference time, the model extracts concept embeddings along various axes from new test images, which can be remixed to generate images with novel compositions of visual concepts. With a lightweight test-time finetuning procedure, it can also generalize to novel concepts unseen at training. Project page at https://cs.stanford.edu/ \u0303yzzhang/projects/concept-axes.",

We consider motion as an important cue for identifying parts, that all particles on the same part share the common motion pattern. From the perspective of fluid simulation, existing deformation-based methods for dynamic NeRF can be seen as parameterizing the scene motion under the Eulerian view, i.e., focusing on specific locations in space through which the fluid flows as time passes. However, it is intractable to extract the motion of constituting objects or parts using the Eulerian view representation. In this work, we introduce the dual Lagrangian view and enforce representations under the Eulerian/Lagrangian views to be cycle-consistent. Under the Lagrangian view, we parameterize the scene motion by tracking the trajectory of particles on objects. The Lagrangian view makes it convenient to discover parts by factorizing the scene motion as a composition of part-level rigid motions. Experimentally, our method can achieve fast and high-quality dynamic scene reconstruction from even a single moving camera, and the induced part-based representation allows direct applications of part tracking, animation, 3D scene editing, etc.",

        "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL), which aims to fully explore offline datasets for training without interaction with environments, has attracted growing recent attention. A major challenge for the real-world application of offline RL stems from the robustness against state observation perturbations, e.g., as a result of sensor errors or adversarial attacks. Unlike online robust RL, agents cannot be adversarially trained in the offline setting. In this work, we propose Diffusion Model-Based Predictor (DMBP) in a new framework that recovers the actual states with conditional diffusion models for state-based RL tasks. To mitigate the error accumulation issue in model-based estimation resulting from the classical training of conventional diffusion models, we propose a non-Markovian training objective to minimize the sum entropy of denoised states in RL trajectory. Experiments on standard benchmark problems demonstrate that DMBP can significantly enhance the robustness of existing offline RL algorithms against different scales of random noises and adversarial attacks on state observations. Further, the proposed framework can effectively deal with incomplete state observations with random combinations of multiple unobserved dimensions in the test.

Though existing approaches in protein design have thoroughly explored structure-to-sequence dependencies in proteins, RNA design still confronts difficulties due to structural complexity and data scarcity. Moreover, direct transplantation of protein design methodologies into RNA design fails to achieve satisfactory outcomes although sharing similar structural components.

We crafted a large, well-curated benchmark dataset and designed a comprehensive structural modeling approach to represent the complex RNA tertiary structure. More importantly, we proposed a hierarchical data-efficient representation learning framework that learns structural representations through contrastive learning at both clusterlevel and sample-level to fully leverage the limited data. By constraining data representations within a limited hyperspherical space, the intrinsic relationships between data points could be explicitly imposed. Moreover, we incorporated extracted secondary structures with base pairs as prior knowledge to facilitate the RNA design process.

We introduce SWAP, a formulation of Entropic Wasserstein regression (EWR) for pruning, capitalizing on the geometric properties of the optimal transport problem. The \u201cswap\u201d of the commonly used linear regression with the EWR in optimization is analytically demonstrated to offer noise mitigation effects by incorporating neighborhood interpolation across data points with only marginal additional computational cost.

        "abstract": "Visual reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in continuous control tasks. Despite its progress, current algorithms are still unsatisfactory in virtually every aspect of the performance such as sample efficiency, asymptotic performance, and their robustness to the choice of random seeds. In this paper, we identify a major shortcoming in existing visual RL methods that is the agents often exhibit sustained inactivity during early training, thereby limiting their ability to explore effectively. Expanding upon this crucial observation, we additionally unveil a significant correlation between the agents\u2019 inclination towards motorically inactive exploration and the absence of neuronal activity within their policy networks. To quantify this inactivity, we adopt dormant ratio (Sokar et al., 2023) as a metric to measure inactivity in the RL agent\u2019s network. Empirically, we also recognize that the dormant ratio can act as a standalone indicator of an agent\u2019s activity level, regardless of the received reward signals. Leveraging the aforementioned insights, we introduce DrM , a method that uses three core mechanisms to guide agents\u2019 exploration-exploitation trade-offs by actively minimizing the dormant ratio. Experiments demonstrate that DrM achieves significant improvements in sample efficiency and asymptotic performance with no broken seeds (76 seeds in total) across three continuous control benchmark environments, including DeepMind Control Suite, MetaWorld, and Adroit. Most importantly, DrM is the first model-free algorithm that consistently solves tasks in both the Dog and Manipulator domains from the DeepMind Control Suite as well as three dexterous hand manipulation tasks without demonstrations in Adroit, all based on pixel observations. 1 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Training Progress 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 Ep iso de R ew ar d Deepmind Control Suite (8 Hard Tasks) 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Training Progress 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Su cc es s R at e MetaWorld (8 Tasks) 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Training Progress 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Su cc es s R at e Adroit (3 Tasks) DrM DrQ-v2 ALIX TACO Figure 1: Success rate and episode reward as a function of training progress for each of the three domains that we consider (Deepmind Control Suite, MetaWorld, Adroit).

        "abstract": "Learning neural subset selection tasks, such as compound selection in AI-aided drug discovery, have become increasingly pivotal across diverse applications. The existing methodologies in the field primarily concentrate on constructing models that capture the relationship between utility function values and subsets within their respective supersets. However, these approaches tend to overlook the valuable information contained within the superset when utilizing neural networks to model set functions. In this work, we address this oversight by adopting a probabilistic perspective. Our theoretical findings demonstrate that when the target value is conditioned on both the input set and subset, it is essential to incorporate an invariant sufficient statistic of the superset into the subset of interest for effective learning. This ensures that the output value remains invariant to permutations of the subset and its corresponding superset, enabling identification of the specific superset from which the subset originated. Motivated by these insights, we propose a simple yet effective information aggregation module designed to merge the representations of subsets and supersets from a permutation invariance perspective. Comprehensive empirical evaluations across diverse tasks and datasets validate the enhanced efficacy of our approach over conventional methods, underscoring the practicality and potency of our proposed strategies in real-world contexts.",

The authors contend that existing approaches primarily construct models to depict the relationship between utility function values and subsets within their corresponding supersets, neglecting the useful insights derived from the superset itself. The proposed framework remedies this limitation by embracing a probabilistic viewpoint and integrates an information aggregation module designed to combine representations of subsets and supersets through the lens of permutation invariance. The authors assess the framework's performance across multiple tasks, such as product recommendation, set anomaly detection, and compound selection in AI-driven drug discovery. The findings indicate that the framework surpasses state-of-the-art methods regarding both accuracy and efficiency.\n\n**Strengths**\n\n1.  The paper presents an innovative framework for neural subset selection that includes permutation invariance.\n2.  The authors conduct a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the framework, presenting the concept of invariant sufficient representation.\n3.  The framework's performance is evaluated across a variety of tasks, including product recommendation, set anomaly detection, and compound selection in AI-assisted drug discovery.\n4.  Results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms leading methods in accuracy and efficiency.\n\n**Weaknesses**\n\n1.  Some sections of the paper may be excessively technical, potentially making it challenging for non-experts to grasp.\n2.  There's a possibility that the authors depend too much on theory, which might complicate practical implementation.\n3.  The evaluation of the compound selection task may be less significant for the framework's overall impact.\n4.  The paper may lack a clear outline regarding future research paths.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement**\n\n1.  The authors might consider providing a more extensive literature review to enhance the understanding of the framework's context and importance.\n2.  A clearer, more concise guide on implementing the framework could make practical application more accessible.\n3.  The relevance of the evaluation on the compound selection task could be improved by including a broader array of tasks to test the framework's capabilities.\n4.  It would be beneficial for the authors to present a clear direction for future research to establish a path for subsequent studies.\n\n**Recommendation**\n\nThe paper introduces a groundbreaking framework for neural subset selection that integrates permutation invariance. The authors provide detailed theoretical insights and evaluate the framework across various tasks, showing superior performance compared to current methods in accuracy and efficiency. The potential implications for AI-aided drug discovery and related set-based tasks underscore the paper's relevance and timeliness. With some revisions to address the suggested improvements, the paper could be enhanced to chart a clear path for future research.",

        "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are attracting growing interest for their energyefficient computing when implemented on neuromorphic hardware. However, directly training SNNs, even adopting batch normalization (BN), is highly challenging due to their non-differentiable activation function and the temporally delayed accumulation of outputs over time. For SNN training, this temporal accumulation gives rise to Temporal Covariate Shifts (TCS) along the temporal dimension, a phenomenon that would become increasingly pronounced with layer-wise computations across multiple layers and multiple time-steps. In this paper, we introduce TAB (Temporal Accumulated Batch Normalization), a novel SNN batch normalization method that addresses the temporal covariate shift issue by aligning with neuron dynamics (specifically the accumulated membrane potential) and utilizing temporal accumulated statistics for data normalization. Within its framework, TAB effectively encapsulates the historical temporal dependencies that underlie the membrane potential accumulation process, thereby establishing a natural connection between neuron dynamics and TAB batch normalization. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and DVS-CIFAR10 show that our TAB method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the rapid progress and broad application of diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs). Sampling from DPMs can be viewed as solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Despite the promising performance, the generation of DPMs usually consumes much time due to the large number of function evaluations (NFE). Though recent works have accelerated the sampling to around 20 steps with high-order solvers, the sample quality with less than 10 NFE can still be improved. In this paper, we propose a unified sampling framework (USF) to study the optional strategies for solver. Under this framework, we further reveal that taking different solving strategies at different timesteps may help further decrease the truncation error, and a carefully designed solver schedule has the potential to improve the sample quality by a large margin. Therefore, we propose a new sampling framework based on the exponential integral formulation that allows free choices of solver strategy at each step and design specific decisions for the framework. Moreover, we propose S, a predictor-based search method that automatically optimizes the solver schedule to get a better time-quality trade-off of sampling. We demonstrate that S can find outstanding solver schedules which outperform the state-of-the-art sampling methods on CIFAR-10, CelebA, ImageNet, and LSUN-Bedroom datasets. Specifically, we achieve 2.69 FID with 10 NFE and 6.86 FID with 5 NFE on CIFAR-10 dataset, outperforming the SOTA method significantly. We further apply S to Stable-Diffusion model and get an acceleration ratio of 2\u00d7, showing the feasibility of sampling in very few steps without retraining the neural network.",

We consider a generalization of the classical (single-round) version of the problem in which the principal interacts with the agent by committing to contracts over multiple rounds. The principal has no information about the agent, and they have to learn an optimal contract by only observing the outcome realized at each round. We focus on settings in which the size of the agent\u2019s action space is small. We design an algorithm that learns an approximately-optimal contract with high probability in a number of rounds polynomial in the size of the outcome space, when the number of actions is constant. Our algorithm solves an open problem by Zhu et al. (2023). Moreover, it can also be employed to provide a \u00d5(T ) regret bound in the related online learning setting in which the principal aims at maximizing their cumulative utility over rounds, considerably improving previously-known regret bounds.",

GPD employs a Transformer-based denoising diffusion model, which is model-agnostic to integrate with powerful spatio-temporal neural networks.

        "abstract": "Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have gained significant popularity among researchers as a powerful tool for understanding unknown distributions based on limited samples. This popularity stems partly from their impressive performance and partly from their ability to provide meaningful feature representations in the latent space. Wasserstein Autoencoders (WAEs), a variant of VAEs, aim to not only improve model efficiency but also interpretability. However, there has been limited focus on analyzing their statistical guarantees. The matter is further complicated by the fact that the data distributions to which WAEs are applied such as natural images are often presumed to possess an underlying low-dimensional structure within a high-dimensional feature space, which current theory does not adequately account for, rendering known bounds inefficient. To bridge the gap between the theory and practice of WAEs, in this paper, we show that WAEs can learn the data distributions when the network architectures are properly chosen. We show that the convergence rates of the expected excess risk in the number of samples for WAEs are independent of the high feature dimension, instead relying only on the intrinsic dimension of the data distribution.",

The framework proposed by the authors elucidates the decomposition of error into optimization error, generalization error, misspecification error, and regularization error. The established bounds on the excess risk reveal a trade-off between generalization and misspecification errors based on the sample size.\n\nA key strength of this paper is the authors' employment of the upper Minkowski dimension of the target distribution's support, which effectively characterizes the intrinsic dimensionality of the data. They also show that the convergence rates of expected excess risk concerning sample size for WAEs remain unaffected by the high feature dimension, aligning with the desired outcomes.\n\nAnother notable strength is the experimental study presented, which reveals that the error rates for the WAE problem are predominantly influenced by the intrinsic dimension of the data. The findings suggest that error rates are lower for cases with 2 latent variables compared to those with 16.\n\nHowever, a limitation of this paper is that the assumptions regarding the Lipschitz-smoothness of the true model and the smoothness of the latent codes seem excessively stringent. Additionally, the applicability of the upper Minkowski dimension may not hold universally.\n\nTo mitigate this concern, the authors could explore alternative methods such as covering number or Kolmogorov complexity for defining intrinsic dimensionality. Moreover, they should strive to establish error bounds in scenarios where the latent space exceeds the intrinsic dimension.\n\nRegarding the first issue, the authors should derive error bounds assuming non-smoothness of latent codes in the limit. They should also explore deriving bounds when latent codes exhibit other types of \"non-smoothness.\"\n\nTo enhance the manuscript, it would be beneficial for the authors to derive error bounds under conditions where the latent space's dimension surpasses that of the intrinsic dimension of the data. They should also work on deriving bounds for cases where the latent codes in the limit show different forms of \"non-smoothness.\"\n\nFor addressing optimization error, the authors ought to derive error bounds in situations where the optimization error is pronounced. They should also consider deriving bounds when the optimization error demonstrates alternative types of \"non-convexity.\"\n\nLastly, it would be advisable for the authors to also derive error bounds for cases in which latent codes in the limit exhibit various forms of \"non-smoothness.\"\n\n$$\\label{Reviewer}\\$",

        "abstract": "Reward modeling (a.k.a., preference modeling) is instrumental for aligning large language models with human preferences, particularly within the context of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). While conventional reward models (RMs) have exhibited remarkable scalability, they oft struggle with fundamental functionality such as arithmetic computation, code execution, and factual lookup. In this paper, we propose a tool-augmented preference modeling approach, named Themis, to address these limitations by empowering RMs with access to external environments, including calculators and search engines. This approach not only fosters synergy between tool utilization and reward grading but also enhances interpretive capacity and scoring reliability. Our study delves into the integration of external tools into RMs, enabling them to interact with diverse external sources and construct task-specific tool engagement and reasoning traces in an autoregressive manner. We validate our approach across a wide range of domains, incorporating seven distinct external tools. Our experimental results demonstrate a noteworthy overall improvement of 17.7% across eight tasks in preference ranking. Furthermore, our approach outperforms Gopher 280B by 7.3% on TruthfulQA task in zero-shot evaluation. In human evaluations, RLHF trained with Themis attains an average win rate of 32% when compared to baselines across four distinct tasks. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive collection of tool-related RM datasets, incorporating data from seven distinct tool APIs, totaling 15,000 instances.

        "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) are adopted as a fundamental component of language technologies, it is crucial to accurately characterize their performance. Because choices in prompt design can strongly influence model behavior, this design process is critical in effectively using any modern pre-trained generative language model. In this work, we focus on LLM sensitivity to a quintessential class of meaning-preserving design choices: prompt formatting. We find that several widely used open-source LLMs are extremely sensitive to subtle changes in prompt formatting in few-shot settings, with performance differences of up to 76 accuracy points when evaluated using LLaMA-2-13B. Sensitivity remains even when increasing model size, the number of few-shot examples, or performing instruction tuning. Our analysis suggests that work evaluating LLMs with prompting-based methods would benefit from reporting a range of performance across plausible prompt formats, instead of the currently-standard practice of reporting performance on a single format. We also show that format performance only weakly correlates between models, which puts into question the methodological validity of comparing models with an arbitrarily chosen, fixed prompt format. To facilitate systematic analysis we propose FORMATSPREAD, an algorithm that rapidly evaluates a sampled set of plausible prompt formats for a given task, and reports the interval of expected performance without accessing model weights1. Furthermore, we present a suite of analyses that characterize the nature of this sensitivity, including exploring the influence of particular atomic perturbations and the internal representation of particular formats.",

They demonstrate that many popular open-source LLMs exhibit significant sensitivity to minor alterations in prompt formatting, leading to performance discrepancies of up to 76 accuracy points. The findings indicate that it is essential to report performance across a spectrum of plausible formats rather than relying on a single format for fair model comparisons.\n\n# Strengths\n\n* The paper identifies a well-defined issue and outlines a clear method for its analysis.\n* FORMATSPREAD serves as a valuable resource for efficiently assessing various prompt formats.\n* The findings reveal marked performance variations among models based on different prompt formats, stressing the importance of acknowledging format variability.\n* The authors conduct a variety of analyses to delineate the nature of this sensitivity, including examining the effects of specific atomic perturbations and the internal representation of certain formats.\n\n# Weaknesses\n\n* Some readers may find the comprehensive grammar definition for FORMATSPREAD to be somewhat opaque and hard to comprehend.\n* The authors could enhance their discussion surrounding the assumptions behind FORMATSPREAD, especially regarding the selection of grammatical constructs for format equivalence.\n* The description of the format generation process in Section A.1.1 may be challenging for some readers to visualize.\n* The results could gain depth from additional experiments exploring how particular features, like text length, influence format variability.\n\n# Suggestions for Improvement\n\n* Offer more comprehensive guidance on using FORMATSPREAD, especially concerning the selection of grammatical constructs for ensuring format equivalence.\n* Consider conducting more experiments to examine the impact of specific features, such as text length, on format variability.\n* Expand the discussion about the underlying assumptions of FORMATSPREAD, particularly in relation to the choice of grammatical structures that ensure format equivalence.\n* Include more results from various models to demonstrate the broader applicability of FORMATSPREAD's findings.\n\n# Recommendation\n\nWe recommend accepting this paper for publication, as it provides an effective method for analyzing format variability in LLMs and includes a variety of analyses to explain the nature of this sensitivity. With a few additional adjustments to address the noted weaknesses, FORMATSPREAD has the potential to become a widely adopted tool for exploring format variability in language models.",

        "abstract": "There has been a recent surge of interest in developing generally-capable agents that can adapt to new tasks without additional training in the environment. Learning world models from reward-free exploration is a promising approach, and enables policies to be trained using imagined experience for new tasks. However, achieving a general agent requires robustness across different environments. In this work, we address the novel problem of generating curricula in the reward-free setting to train robust world models. We consider robustness in terms of minimax regret over all environment instantiations and show that the minimax regret can be connected to minimising the maximum error in the world model across environment instances. This result informs our algorithm, WAKER: Weighted Acquisition of Knowledge across Environments for Robustness. WAKER selects environments for data collection based on the estimated error of the world model for each environment. Our experiments demonstrate that WAKER outperforms several baselines, resulting in improved robustness, efficiency, and generalisation.",

        "abstract": "In-context learning is a promising paradigm that utilizes in-context examples as prompts for the predictions of large language models. These prompts are crucial for achieving strong performance. However, since the prompts need to be sampled from a large volume of annotated examples, finding the right prompt may result in high annotation costs. To address this challenge, this paper introduces an influence-driven selective annotation method that aims to minimize annotation costs while improving the quality of in-context examples. The essence of our method is to select a pivotal subset from a large-scale unlabeled data pool to annotate for the subsequent sampling of prompts. Specifically, a directed graph is first constructed to represent unlabeled data. Afterward, the influence of candidate unlabeled subsets is quantified with a diffusion process. A simple yet effective greedy algorithm for unlabeled data selection is lastly introduced. It iteratively selects the data if it provides a maximum marginal gain with respect to quantified influence. Compared with previous efforts on selective annotations, our influencedriven method works in an end-to-end manner, avoids an intractable explicit balance between data diversity and representativeness, and enjoys theoretical support. Experiments confirm the superiority of the proposed method on various benchmarks, achieving better performance under lower time consumption during subset selection.

        "title": "WIN-WIN: TRAINING HIGH-RESOLUTION VISION TRANSFORMERS",
        "abstract": "Transformers have become the standard in state-of-the-art vision architectures, achieving impressive performance on both image-level and dense pixelwise tasks. However, training vision transformers for high-resolution pixelwise tasks has a prohibitive cost. Typical solutions boil down to hierarchical architectures, fast and approximate attention, or training on low-resolution crops. This latter solution does not constrain architectural choices, but it leads to a clear performance drop when testing at resolutions significantly higher than that used for training, thus requiring ad-hoc and slow post-processing schemes. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for efficient training and inference of high-resolution vision transformers: the key principle is to mask out most of the high-resolution inputs during training, keeping only N random windows. This allows the model to learn local interactions between tokens inside each window, and global interactions between tokens from different windows. As a result, the model can directly process the high-resolution input at test time without any special trick. We show that this strategy is effective when using relative positional embedding such as rotary embeddings. It is 4 times faster to train than a full-resolution network, and it is straightforward to use at test time compared to existing approaches. We apply this strategy to two dense prediction tasks with high resolution data. First, we show on the task of semantic segmentation that a simple setting with 2 windows performs best, hence the name of our method: Win-Win. To demonstrate the generality of our contribution, we further extend it to the binocular task of optical flow, reaching state-of-the-art performance on the Spring benchmark that contains Full-HD images with an inference time an order of magnitude faster than the best competitor. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Training time (hours) 45 50 55 60 m ea n Io U Semantic segmentation on BDD100k Win-Win (31GB) Full-res.

        "abstract": "Existing losses used in deep metric learning (DML) for image retrieval often lead to highly non-uniform intra-class and inter-class representation structures across test classes and data distributions. When combined with the common practice of using a fixed threshold to declare a match, this gives rise to significant performance variations in terms of false accept rate (FAR) and false reject rate (FRR) across test classes and data distributions. We define this issue in DML as threshold inconsistency. In real-world applications, such inconsistency often complicates the threshold selection process when deploying commercial image retrieval systems. To measure this inconsistency, we propose a novel variance-based metric called Operating-Point-Inconsistency-Score (OPIS) that quantifies the variance in the operating characteristics across classes. Using the OPIS metric, we find that achieving high accuracy levels in a DML model does not automatically guarantee threshold consistency. In fact, our investigation reveals a Pareto frontier in the high-accuracy regime, where existing methods to improve accuracy often lead to degradation in threshold consistency. To address this trade-off, we introduce the Threshold-Consistent Margin (TCM) loss, a simple yet effective regularization technique that promotes uniformity in representation structures across classes by selectively penalizing hard sample pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate TCM\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing threshold consistency while preserving accuracy, simplifying the threshold selection process in practical DML settings.",

        "abstract": "COMpression with Bayesian Implicit NEural Representations (COMBINER) is a recent data compression method that addresses a key inefficiency of previous Implicit Neural Representation (INR)-based approaches: it avoids quantization and enables direct optimization of the rate-distortion performance. However, COMBINER still has significant limitations: 1) it uses factorized priors and posterior approximations that lack flexibility; 2) it cannot effectively adapt to local deviations from global patterns in the data; and 3) its performance can be susceptible to modeling choices and the variational parameters\u2019 initializations. Our proposed method, Robust and Enhanced COMBINER (RECOMBINER), addresses these issues by 1) enriching the variational approximation while retaining a low computational cost via a linear reparameterization of the INR weights, 2) augmenting our INRs with learnable positional encodings that enable them to adapt to local details and 3) splitting high-resolution data into patches to increase robustness and utilizing expressive hierarchical priors to capture dependency across patches. We conduct extensive experiments across several data modalities, showcasing that RECOMBINER achieves competitive results with the best INR-based methods and even outperforms autoencoder-based codecs on lowresolution images at low bitrates.

ModernTCN leverages cross-time and cross-variable dependencies for analysis, accomplished through a contemporary convolution block that integrates architectural features from Transformers, DWConv (depthwise convolution) for feature-independent information, and a fully convolutional feedforward network (ConvFFN) for both feature and variable-independent information.

This aspect appears to be absent from the study, as the authors do not attempt to scale the model to larger datasets, which might explain its weaker robustness in unfamiliar scenarios.\n- The paper lacks an analysis of the model's parameters to identify which are most critical for its performance.

Through the lens of discrete cosine transformation, we find the main reason is that the same noise level on a higher resolution results in a higher Signal-to-Noise Ratio in the frequency domain. In this work, we present Relay Diffusion Model (RDM), which transfers a low-resolution image or noise into an equivalent high-resolution one for diffusion model via blurring diffusion and block noise. Therefore, the diffusion process can continue seamlessly in any new resolution or model without restarting from pure noise or lowresolution conditioning. RDM achieves state-of-the-art FID on CelebA-HQ and sFID on ImageNet 256\u00d7256, surpassing previous works such as ADM, LDM and DiT by a large margin.

        "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great promise in learning node embeddings for link prediction (LP). While numerous studies aim to improve the overall LP performance of GNNs, none have explored its varying performance across different nodes and its underlying reasons. To this end, we aim to demystify which nodes will perform better from the perspective of their local topology. Despite the widespread belief that low-degree nodes exhibit poorer LP performance, our empirical findings provide nuances to this viewpoint and prompt us to propose a better metric, Topological Concentration (TC), based on the intersection of the local subgraph of each node with the ones of its neighbors. We empirically demonstrate that TC has a higher correlation with LP performance than other node-level topological metrics like degree and subgraph density, offering a better way to identify low-performing nodes than using degree. With TC, we discover a novel topological distribution shift issue in which newly joined neighbors of a node tend to become less interactive with that node\u2019s existing neighbors, compromising the generalizability of node embeddings for LP at testing time. To make the computation of TC scalable, We further propose Approximated Topological Concentration (ATC) and theoretically/empirically justify its efficacy in approximating TC and reducing the computation complexity. Given the positive correlation between node TC and its LP performance, we explore the potential of boosting LP performance via enhancing TC by re-weighting edges in the message-passing and discuss its effectiveness with limitations.

        "abstract": "Contrastive learning has emerged as a popular paradigm of self-supervised learning that learns representations by encouraging representations of positive pairs to be similar while representations of negative pairs to be far apart. The spectral contrastive loss, in synergy with the notion of positive-pair graphs, offers valuable theoretical insights into the empirical successes of contrastive learning. In this paper, we propose incorporating an additive factor into the term of spectral contrastive loss involving negative pairs. This simple modification can be equivalently viewed as introducing a regularization term that enforces the mean of representations to be zero, which thus is referred to as zero-mean regularization. It intuitively relaxes the orthogonality of representations between negative pairs and implicitly alleviates the adverse effect of wrong connections in the positive-pair graph, leading to better performance and robustness. To clarify this, we thoroughly investigate the role of zero-mean regularized spectral contrastive loss in both unsupervised and supervised scenarios with respect to theoretical analysis and quantitative evaluation.

In this context, the existing literature provides a sample complexity upper bound of \u00d5(|S||A|tmix\u03b5)* and a lower bound of \u03a9(|S||A|tmix\u03b5). In these expressions, |S| and |A| denote the cardinalities of the state and action spaces respectively, tmix serves as a uniform upper limit for the total variation mixing times, and \u03b5 signifies the error tolerance. Therefore, a notable gap of tmix still remains to be bridged. Our primary contribution is the development of an estimator for the optimal policy of average reward MDPs with a sample complexity of \u00d5(|S||A|tmix\u03b5). This marks the first algorithm and analysis to reach the literature\u2019s lower bound. Our new algorithm draws inspiration from ideas in Li et al. (2020), Jin & Sidford (2021), and Wang et al.

        "abstract": "We study the notion of a generalization bound being uniformly tight, meaning that the difference between the bound and the population loss is small for all learning algorithms and all population distributions. Numerous generalization bounds have been proposed in the literature as potential explanations for the ability of neural networks to generalize in the overparameterized setting. However, in their paper \u201cFantastic Generalization Measures and Where to Find Them,\u201d Jiang et al. (2020) examine more than a dozen generalization bounds, and show empirically that none of them are uniformly tight. This raises the question of whether uniformly-tight generalization bounds are at all possible in the overparameterized setting. We consider two types of generalization bounds: (1) bounds that may depend on the training set and the learned hypothesis (e.g., margin bounds). We prove mathematically that no such bound can be uniformly tight in the overparameterized setting; (2) bounds that may in addition also depend on the learning algorithm (e.g., stability bounds). For these bounds, we show a trade-off between the algorithm\u2019s performance and the bound\u2019s tightness. Namely, if the algorithm achieves good accuracy on certain distributions, then no generalization bound can be uniformly tight for it in the overparameterized setting. We explain how these formal results can, in our view, inform research on generalization bounds for neural networks, while stressing that other interpretations of these results are also possible.",

        "peer_review_with_watermark": "The paper titled \"Fantastic Generalization Measures\" investigates the idea that generalization bounds can be uniformly tight, implying that the variance between the bound and the true population loss is minimal across all learning algorithms and population distributions. The authors propose two categories of generalization bounds: distribution-and-algorithm-independent bounds, which solely rely on the training dataset and the hypothesis derived, and algorithm-dependent bounds, which take the learning algorithm into account.\n\n**Summary of the Paper:**\nThe paper delivers a comprehensive review of generalization bounds in relation to overparameterization. The authors contend that several prevailing generalization bounds lack significance or fail to be uniformly tight in the context of overparameterization. They present two concepts: estimability and algorithm-related estimability, both crucial to their findings. The paper articulates two primary conclusions: (1) no generalization bound presented in the form of Eq. (1) maintains uniform tightness in the overparameterized landscape; and (2) for algorithm-dependent bounds, there is a compromise between the performance of learning and estimability.\n\n**Strengths:**\nThis paper offers a clear and detailed examination of generalization bounds, emphasizing their shortcomings in overparameterized situations. The introduction of estimability concepts is vital to their claims, and numerous practical examples illustrate these ideas effectively.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\nThe technical aspects of the main result on algorithm-dependent bounds might occasionally be perceived as complex or challenging to grasp. The authors' presumption that the learning algorithm works for Theorem 3 may not seem plausible for various scenarios. Additionally, some readers could find the technical explicitness overwhelming.\n\n**Suggestions for Enhancement:**\nTo enhance clarity, the authors might include more real-world examples to exemplify their main findings regarding algorithm-dependent bounds. They could also clarify their assumptions about the learning algorithm's suitability for Theorem 3 to make them more realistic. Furthermore, highlighting the practical ramifications of their conclusions and proposing future research avenues could be beneficial.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nThe paper offers an insightful and detailed examination of generalization bounds in the context of overparameterization. While some technical nuances may sometimes appear excessive, the central findings present valuable insights into the limitations of such bounds. We recommend publishing the paper as is, with minor revisions that emphasize technical clarifications and illustrations. \n\nOverall, the paper's principal finding regarding vacuity or non-uniform tightness of generalization bounds in overparameterized settings offers compelling insights. The authors' introduction of the concepts of estimability and algorithm-dependent estimability lays a solid conceptual groundwork for understanding these findings.\n\n**Conclusion of the Paper:**\nThe authors articulate a wide-ranging discussion surrounding generalization bounds, identifying their limitations and practical implications. Their discussion revolves around two notions\u2014estimability and estimability concerning algorithms\u2014central to their findings, concluding with two important assertions regarding the non-uniform tightness and a performance-estimability trade-off within algorithm-dependent bounds. \n\n**Strengths Recap:**\nThe paper encompasses a significant dialogue on generalization bounds, elucidating their limitations and relevance to practical applications. The incorporation of key concepts\u2014estimability and its relationship with algorithms\u2014reinforces their arguments, accompanied by a wealth of examples.\n\n**Weaknesses Recap:**\nThe discussion on generalization bounds can be seen as overly extensive, and certain technical elements may feel burdensome.\n\n**Improvements Recap:**\nTo bolster the paper, authors can streamline the literature review while accentuating the practical ramifications of their findings, thereby making it more accessible.\n\n**Final Recommendation Recap:**\nThis paper presents a compelling and comprehensive discussion regarding generalization bounds and their restrictions, and while it contains some excessive technical detail, its core assertions are enlightening.

To tackle such limitations of existing NAS methods, we propose a paradigm shift from NAS to a novel conditional Neural Architecture Generation (NAG) framework based on diffusion models, dubbed DiffusionNAG. Specifically, we consider the neural architectures as directed graphs and propose a graph diffusion model for generating them. Moreover, with the guidance of parameterized predictors, DiffusionNAG can flexibly generate task-optimal architectures with the desired properties for diverse tasks, by sampling from a region that is more likely to satisfy the properties. This conditional NAG scheme is significantly more efficient than previous NAS schemes which sample the architectures and filter them using the property predictors. We validate the effectiveness of DiffusionNAG through extensive experiments in two predictor-based NAS scenarios: Transferable NAS and Bayesian Optimization (BO)-based NAS. DiffusionNAG achieves superior performance with speedups of up to 20\u00d7 when compared to the baselines on Transferable NAS benchmarks.

        "title": "LIPSCHITZ SINGULARITIES IN DIFFUSION MODELS",
        "abstract": "Diffusion models, which employ stochastic differential equations to sample images through integrals, have emerged as a dominant class of generative models. However, the rationality of the diffusion process itself receives limited attention, leaving the question of whether the problem is well-posed and well-conditioned. In this paper, we explore a perplexing tendency of diffusion models: they often display the infinite Lipschitz property of the network with respect to time variable near the zero point. We provide theoretical proofs to illustrate the presence of infinite Lipschitz constants and empirical results to confirm it. The Lipschitz singularities pose a threat to the stability and accuracy during both the training and inference processes of diffusion models. Therefore, the mitigation of Lipschitz singularities holds great potential for enhancing the performance of diffusion models. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach, dubbed E-TSDM, which alleviates the Lipschitz singularities of the diffusion model near the zero point of timesteps. Remarkably, our technique yields a substantial improvement in performance. Moreover, as a byproduct of our method, we achieve a dramatic reduction in the Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance of acceleration methods relying on network Lipschitz, including DDIM and DPM-Solver, by over 33%. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets validate our theory and method. Our work may advance the understanding of the general diffusion process, and also provide insights for the design of diffusion models.",

        "abstract": "The objective of domain generalization (DG) is to enhance the transferability of the model learned from a source domain to unobserved domains. To prevent overfitting to a specific domain, Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) reduces source domain\u2019s loss sharpness. Although SAM variants have delivered significant improvements in DG, we highlight that there\u2019s still potential for improvement in generalizing to unknown domains through the exploration on data space. This paper introduces an objective rooted in both parameter and data perturbed regions for domain generalization, coined Unknown Domain Inconsistency Minimization (UDIM). UDIM reduces the loss landscape inconsistency between source domain and unknown domains. As unknown domains are inaccessible, these domains are empirically crafted by perturbing instances from the source domain dataset. In particular, by aligning the loss landscape acquired in the source domain to the loss landscape of perturbed domains, we expect to achieve generalization grounded on these flat minima for the unknown domains. Theoretically, we validate that merging SAM optimization with the UDIM objective establishes an upper bound for the true objective of the DG task. In an empirical aspect, UDIM consistently outperforms SAM variants across multiple DG benchmark datasets. Notably, UDIM shows statistically significant improvements in scenarios with more restrictive domain information, underscoring UDIM\u2019s generalization capability in unseen domains.

        "abstract": "Imposing known physical constraints, such as conservation laws, during neural network training introduces an inductive bias that can improve accuracy, reliability, convergence, and data efficiency for modeling physical dynamics. While such constraints can be softly imposed via loss function penalties, recent advancements in differentiable physics and optimization improve performance by incorporating PDE-constrained optimization as individual layers in neural networks. This enables a stricter adherence to physical constraints. However, imposing hard constraints significantly increases computational and memory costs, especially for complex dynamical systems. This is because it requires solving an optimization problem over a large number of points in a mesh, representing spatial and temporal discretizations, which greatly increases the complexity of the constraint. To address this challenge, we develop a scalable approach to enforce hard physical constraints using Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), which can be used with any neural network architecture. Our approach imposes the constraint over smaller decomposed domains, each of which is solved by an \u201cexpert\u201d through differentiable optimization. During training, each expert independently performs a localized backpropagation step by leveraging the implicit function theorem; the independence of each expert allows for parallelization across multiple GPUs. Compared to standard differentiable optimization, our scalable approach achieves greater accuracy in the neural PDE solver setting for predicting the dynamics of challenging non-linear systems. We also improve training stability and require significantly less computation time during both training and inference stages.",

        "abstract": "Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) is tasked with learning to achieve multiple goals in an environment purely from offline datasets using sparse reward functions. Offline GCRL is pivotal for developing generalist agents capable of leveraging pre-existing datasets to learn diverse and reusable skills without hand-engineering reward functions. However, contemporary approaches to GCRL based on supervised learning and contrastive learning are often suboptimal in the offline setting. An alternative perspective on GCRL optimizes for occupancy matching, but necessitates learning a discriminator, which subsequently serves as a pseudo-reward for downstream RL. Inaccuracies in the learned discriminator can cascade, negatively influencing the resulting policy. We present a novel approach to GCRL under a new lens of mixture-distribution matching, leading to our discriminator-free method: SMORe. The key insight is combining the occupancy matching perspective of GCRL with a convex dual formulation to derive a learning objective that can better leverage suboptimal offline data. SMORe learns scores or unnormalized densities representing the importance of taking an action at a state for reaching a particular goal. SMORe is principled and our extensive experiments on the fully offline GCRL benchmark composed of robot manipulation and locomotion tasks, including high-dimensional observations, show that SMORe can outperform state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin.",

A popular approach towards obtaining such agents is to reuse skills learned in prior tasks to generalise compositionally to new ones. However, this is a challenging problem due to the curse of dimensionality induced by the combinatorially large number of ways high-level goals can be combined both logically and temporally in language. To address this problem, we propose a framework where an agent first learns a sufficient set of skill primitives to achieve all high-level goals in its environment. The agent can then flexibly compose them both logically and temporally to provably achieve temporal logic specifications in any regular language, such as regular fragments of linear temporal logic. This provides the agent with the ability to map from complex temporal logic task specifications to near-optimal behaviours zero-shot. We demonstrate this experimentally in a tabular setting, as well as in a high-dimensional video game and continuous control environment.

        "peer_review_with_watermark": "$$$ Paper Summary:\nThe paper introduces the DiLu framework, which is a knowledge-based approach to autonomous driving that combines an interactive environment, a driver agent, and a memory element to tackle issues such as dataset bias, overfitting, and lack of interpretability in data-centric autonomous driving systems. This framework utilizes large language models (LLMs) with emergent capabilities to aid in decision-making through common-sense knowledge while adapting continuously. Comprehensive experiments show that DiLu is effective in building experience and exhibits superior generalization capabilities compared to reinforcement learning-based methods.\n\nStrengths:\n1. The paper presents a novel and creative method for autonomous driving that incorporates human-like knowledge into the decision-making process.\n2. Employing LLMs with emergent capabilities for decision-making is a distinct and effective strategy.\n3. Extensive experiments confirm DiLu's ability to gather experience and show a noteworthy advantage in generalization skills.\n4. The paper emphasizes the significance of addressing dataset bias, overfitting, and uninterpretability within data-driven autonomous driving frameworks.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. The decision-making latency of the framework, which includes LLM inference and API response times, could be a drawback.\n2. The paper does not fully eliminate the hallucinations produced by LLMs.\n3. The framework depends on a memory module that records experiences as natural language text, which may limit its expressiveness.\n4. The potential restrictions of utilizing LLMs in autonomous driving systems are not discussed in the paper.\n\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n1. Explore solutions to minimize decision-making latency, such as optimizing LLMs or caching API results.\n2. Create techniques to mitigate hallucinations from LLMs, possibly by incorporating attention mechanisms or multi-modal sensing.\n3. Consider using alternative memory modules that could represent experiences in more expressive forms, like symbolic representations.\n4. Address the possible limitations of LLMs in autonomous driving systems, including their dependence on extensive labeled data.\n\nRecommendation:\nThe DiLu framework represents a novel and creative approach to autonomous driving by integrating human-level knowledge into the decision-making process. Its ability to gather experience and demonstrate a major advantage in generalization is evidenced by thorough experiments. Despite some limitations and opportunities for improvement, this framework holds promise as an effective solution for autonomous driving systems. \n\n $$$ ",

        "title": "GENERALIZATION: UNRAVELING LEARNING DIFFER-",
        "abstract": "This paper investigates discrepancies in how neural networks learn from different imaging domains, which are commonly overlooked when adopting computer vision techniques from the domain of natural images to other specialized domains such as medical images. Recent works have found that the generalization error of a trained network typically increases with the intrinsic dimension (ddata) of its training set. Yet, the steepness of this relationship varies significantly between medical (radiological) and natural imaging domains, with no existing theoretical explanation. We address this gap in knowledge by establishing and empirically validating a generalization scaling law with respect to ddata, and propose that the substantial scaling discrepancy between the two considered domains may be at least partially attributed to the higher intrinsic \u201clabel sharpness\u201d (KF ) of medical imaging datasets, a metric which we propose. Next, we demonstrate an additional benefit of measuring the label sharpness of a training set: it is negatively correlated with the trained model\u2019s adversarial robustness, which notably leads to models for medical images having a substantially higher vulnerability to adversarial attack. Finally, we extend our ddata formalism to the related metric of learned representation intrinsic dimension (drepr), derive a generalization scaling law with respect to drepr, and show that ddata serves as an upper bound for drepr. Our theoretical results are supported by thorough experiments with six models and eleven natural and medical imaging datasets over a range of training set sizes. Our findings offer insights into the influence of intrinsic dataset properties on generalization, representation learning, and robustness in deep neural networks.1",

The authors propose a generalization scaling law concerning intrinsic dimension and introduce a new metric for intrinsic label sharpness. The findings indicate that the greater intrinsic label sharpness of medical datasets may account for the differing scaling rates in generalization ability between natural and medical image datasets. Additionally, the authors demonstrate a negative correlation between higher intrinsic label sharpness of datasets and the model\u2019s adversarial robustness. This research has practical implications for designing neural networks that can effectively manage diverse datasets and enhance resilience against adversarial attacks.\n\nStrengths:\n1. The paper delivers an in-depth analysis of the connections among neural network generalization ability, the intrinsic dimension of the training set, and the intrinsic label sharpness of datasets. The introduction of intrinsic label sharpness as a metric enriches the analysis.\n2. The empirical assessment of the model across multiple datasets from both natural and medical imaging domains presents strong evidence for the identified relationships. The experiments meticulously address various factors that may affect the results, such as model architectures, training set sizes, and properties of the datasets.\n3. The explanations for Theorem 1, Theorem 2, Theorem 3, and Theorem 4 are clearly articulated, illustrating the relationships between neural network performance and the intrinsic properties of datasets. The proofs for Theorem 3 and Theorem 4 furnish essential tools for understanding the effects of high intrinsic label sharpness on model robustness and representation learning.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. The study concentrates on binary classification datasets. Expanding the analysis to include multi-class classification datasets could yield additional insights into the connections among neural network performance and the intrinsic properties of datasets. Investigating other machine learning models could offer further perspectives on this issue.\n2. The analysis overlooks other potential factors influencing neural network performance. Examining the impacts of hyperparameter tuning, model pruning, and transfer learning on performance could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the problem. Evaluating neural networks across diverse datasets could enhance the comprehension of this topic.\n3. A more thorough discussion of the practical implications of this analysis would provide a better understanding of the issue. Repeating this discussion within the analysis has the potential to give more clarity to the problem. Addressing these practical implications could elaborate on the overall understanding of this area of research.",

TMDM harnesses the power of transformers to extract essential insights from historical time series data.

        "abstract": "We deal with the combinatorial problem of learning directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure from observational data adhering to a linear structural equation model (SEM). Leveraging advances in differentiable, nonconvex characterizations of acyclicity, recent efforts have advocated a continuous constrained optimization paradigm to efficiently explore the space of DAGs. Most existing methods employ lasso-type score functions to guide this search, which (i) require expensive penalty parameter retuning when the unknown SEM noise variances change across problem instances; and (ii) implicitly rely on limiting homoscedasticity assumptions. In this work, we propose a new convex score function for sparsity-aware learning of linear DAGs, which incorporates concomitant estimation of scale and thus effectively decouples the sparsity parameter from the exogenous noise levels. Regularization via a smooth, nonconvex acyclicity penalty term yields CoLiDE (Concomitant Linear DAG Estimation), a regression-based criterion amenable to efficient gradient computation and closed-form estimation of noise variances in heteroscedastic scenarios. Our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods without incurring added complexity, especially when the DAGs are larger and the noise level profile is heterogeneous. We also find CoLiDE exhibits enhanced stability manifested via reduced standard deviations in several domain-specific metrics, underscoring the robustness of our novel linear DAG estimator.",

Additionally, CoLiDE has a competitive edge over other leading methods such as GOLEM, DAGuerreotype, and TOPO, as it does not rely on prior knowledge of noise variance, which is typically unknown in real-world situations, thus removing the requirement for hyperparameter tuning.\n\n$$$$Weaknesses:\nHowever, the CoLiDE method does not tackle the issue of non-identifiable linear Gaussian SEMs that cannot be determined from observational data, except for the specific circumstance where all noises have identical variance (the homoscedastic setting). Furthermore, CoLiDE fails to handle non-Gaussian errors, which may also occur within linear Gaussian SEMs, thereby restricting CoLiDE's applicability in various contexts.\n\n$$$$Suggestions for Improvement:\nTo enhance the CoLiDE framework, it is recommended to extend its capabilities to include non-identifiable linear Gaussian SEMs. This could involve the introduction of additional methodologies, such as Bayesian techniques, non-Gaussian error handling, and/or alternative approaches that can address non-identifiability.",

        "abstract": "Addressing the limitations of text as a source of accurate layout representation in text-conditional diffusion models, many works incorporate additional signals to condition certain attributes within a generated image. Although successful, previous works do not account for the specific localization of said attributes extended into the three dimensional plane. In this context, we present a conditional diffusion model that integrates control over three-dimensional object placement with disentangled representations of global stylistic semantics from multiple exemplar images. Specifically, we first introduce depth disentanglement training to leverage the relative depth of objects as an estimator, allowing the model to identify the absolute positions of unseen objects through the use of synthetic image triplets. We also introduce soft guidance, a method for imposing global semantics onto targeted regions without the use of any additional localization cues. Our integrated framework, COMPOSE AND CONQUER (CNC), unifies these techniques to localize multiple conditions in a disentangled manner. We demonstrate that our approach allows perception of objects at varying depths while offering a versatile framework for composing localized objects with different global semantics.",

Recently, neural operators have emerged as a promising technique to solve elliptic PDEs more efficiently by directly mapping the input to solutions. However, existing networks typically cannot handle complex geometries and inhomogeneous boundary values present in the real world. Here we introduce Boundary-Embedded Neural Operators (BENO), a novel neural operator architecture that embeds the complex geometries and inhomogeneous boundary values into the solving of elliptic PDEs. Inspired by classical Green\u2019s function, BENO consists of two branches of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for interior source term and boundary values, respectively. Furthermore, a Transformer encoder maps the global boundary geometry into a latent vector which influences each message passing layer of the GNNs. We test our model extensively in elliptic PDEs with various boundary conditions. We show that all existing baseline methods fail to learn the solution operator. In contrast, our model, endowed with boundary-embedded architecture, outperforms state-of-the-art neural operators and strong baselines by an average of 60.96%.

        "abstract": "Programming-by-example is the task of synthesizing a program that is consistent with a set of user-provided input-output examples. As examples are often an under-specification of one\u2019s intent, a good synthesizer must choose the intended program from the many that are consistent with the given set of examples. Prior work frames program synthesis as a cooperative game between a listener (that synthesizes programs) and a speaker (a user choosing examples), and shows that models of computational pragmatic inference are effective in choosing the user intended programs. However, these models require counterfactual reasoning over a large set of programs and examples, which is infeasible in realistic program spaces. In this paper, we propose a novel way to amortize this search with neural networks. We sample pairs of programs and examples via self-play between listener and speaker models, and use pragmatic inference to choose informative training examples from this sample. We then use the informative dataset to train models to improve the synthesizer\u2019s ability to disambiguate user-provided examples without human supervision. We validate our method on the challenging task of synthesizing regular expressions from example strings, and find that our method (1) outperforms models trained without choosing pragmatic examples by 23% (a 51% relative increase) (2) matches the performance of supervised learning on a dataset of pragmatic examples provided by humans, despite using no human data in training.",

Semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations have recently been proposed for solving the K-means optimization problem that enjoy strong statistical optimality guarantees, but the prohibitive cost of implementing an SDP solver renders these guarantees inaccessible to practical datasets. By contrast, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a simple clustering algorithm that is widely used by machine learning practitioners, but without a solid statistical underpinning nor rigorous guarantees. In this paper, we describe an NMF-like algorithm that works by solving a nonnegative low-rank restriction of the SDP relaxed K-means formulation using a nonconvex Burer\u2013Monteiro factorization approach. The resulting algorithm is just as simple and scalable as state-of-theart NMF algorithms, while also enjoying the same strong statistical optimality guarantees as the SDP.

Sparsification provides a solution to alleviate these resource constraints, and recent works have shown that trained models can be sparsified post-hoc. Existing sparsification techniques face challenges as they need additional data structures and offer constrained speedup with current hardware. In this paper we present SliceGPT, a new post-training sparsification scheme which replaces each weight matrix with a smaller (dense) matrix, reducing the embedding dimension of the network. Through extensive experimentation, we show that SliceGPT can remove up to 25% of the model parameters (including embeddings) for OPT 66B and LLAMA-2 70B models with modest loss in accuracy (superior to 2:4 sparsity). Our sliced models run on fewer GPUs and run faster without any additional code optimization: on 24GB consumer GPUs we reduce the total compute for inference on LLAMA-2 70B to 64% of that of the dense model; on 40GB A100 GPUs we reduce it to 66%.

        "abstract": "In federated learning (FL), data heterogeneity is one key bottleneck that causes model divergence and limits performance. Addressing this, existing methods often regard data heterogeneity as an inherent property and propose to mitigate its adverse effects by correcting models. In this paper, we seek to break this inherent property by generating data to complement the original dataset to fundamentally mitigate heterogeneity level. As a novel attempt from the perspective of data, we propose federated learning with consensus-oriented generation (FedCOG). FedCOG consists of two key components at the client side: complementary data generation, which generates data extracted from the shared global model to complement the original dataset, and knowledge-distillation-based model training, which distills knowledge from global model to local model based on the generated data to mitigate over-fitting the original heterogeneous dataset. FedCOG has two critical advantages: 1) it can be a plug-and-play module to further improve the performance of most existing FL methods, and 2) it is naturally compatible with standard FL protocols such as Secure Aggregation since it makes no modification in communication process. Extensive experiments on classical and real-world FL datasets show that FedCOG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods .",

        "abstract": "Transformer models have demonstrated high accuracy in numerous applications but have high complexity and lack sequential processing capability making them ill-suited for many streaming applications at the edge where devices are heavily resource-constrained. Thus motivated, many researchers have proposed reformulating the transformer models as RNN modules which modify the self-attention computation with explicit states. However, these approaches often incur significant performance degradation. The ultimate goal is to develop a model that has the following properties: parallel training, streaming and low-cost inference, and state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. In this paper, we propose a new direction to achieve this goal. We show how architectural modifications to a fully-sequential recurrent model can help push its performance toward Transformer models while retaining its sequential processing capability. Specifically, inspired by the recent success of Legendre Memory Units (LMU) in sequence learning tasks, we propose LMUFormer, which augments the LMU with convolutional patch embedding and convolutional channel mixer. Moreover, we present a spiking version of this architecture, which introduces the benefit of states within the patch embedding and channel mixer modules while simultaneously reducing the computing complexity. We evaluated our architectures on multiple sequence datasets. Of particular note is our performance on the Speech Commands V2 dataset (35 classes). In comparison to SOTA transformer-based models within the ANN domain, our LMUFormer demonstrates comparable performance while necessitating a remarkable 53\u00d7 reduction in parameters and a substantial 65\u00d7 decrement in FLOPs. Furthermore, when benchmarked against extant low-complexity SNN variants, our model establishes a new SOTA with an accuracy of 96.12%. Additionally, owing to our model\u2019s proficiency in real-time data processing, we are able to achieve a 32.03% reduction in sequence length, all while incurring an inconsequential decline in performance.

However, the ability to precisely edit the layout, position, pose, and shape of objects in images with diffusion models is still difficult. To this end, we propose motion guidance, a zero-shot technique that allows a user to specify dense, complex motion fields that indicate where each pixel in an image should move. Motion guidance works by steering the diffusion sampling process with the gradients through an off-the-shelf optical flow network. Specifically, we design a guidance loss that encourages the sample to have the desired motion, as estimated by a flow network, while also being visually similar to the source image.

With further enhancement and refinement, achieving high-quality edits with improved stability and robustness is a viable possibility.\n\nA notable strength of this method is the authors' implementation of a guidance loss function aimed at balancing the trade-off between motion and visual fidelity; however, its effectiveness in capturing the subtleties of motion guidance may be limited.\n\nThe application of an occlusion mask to manage disocclusions represents another significant strength, though there may be shortcomings in how well it captures the intricacies of disocclusions.\n\nUsing a recursive denoising technique to ensure the optimization process remains stable is also a major advantage, but its effectiveness in addressing the subtleties of motion guidance may be restricted.\n\nThe authors' success in completing motion edits on both real and synthetic images is another strong point, yet there may be challenges in adequately handling complex movements.\n\nOverall, this method holds substantial potential for motion guidance through diffusion models. With further improvements, it may be possible to produce high-quality edits with greater stability and robustness.\n\nFuture enhancements could involve refining the guidance loss function, improving the occlusion mask, and enhancing the recursive denoising technique. Additionally, there may be room for enhancement by employing more advanced motion estimation or image manipulation models.\n\nWhen considering future research, there are many avenues for further development of this approach. Potential areas of exploration could include:\n\n*   Creating more advanced motion estimation models.\n*   Designing more sophisticated image manipulation models.\n*   Enhancing the overall stability and robustness of the method.\n*   Exploring the application of this approach to various image manipulation tasks.\n*   Investigating the use of this method for different image guidance roles.\n\nIn conclusion, the proposed strategy offers substantial potential for motion guidance utilizing diffusion models. With ongoing development and refinement, achieving high-quality edits with improved stability and robustness is within reach.",

        "abstract": "Conventional causal discovery approaches, which seek to uncover causal relationships among measured variables, are typically sensitive to the presence of latent variables. While various methods have been developed to address this confounding issue, they often rely on strong assumptions about the underlying causal structure. In this paper, we consider a general scenario where measured and latent variables collectively form a partially observed causally sufficient linear system and latent variables may be anywhere in the causal structure. We theoretically show that with the aid of high-order statistics, the causal graph is (almost) fully identifiable if, roughly speaking, each latent set has a sufficient number of pure children, which can be either latent or measured. Naturally, LiNGAM, a model without latent variables, is encompassed as a special case. Based on the identification theorem, we develop a principled algorithm to identify the causal graph by testing for statistical independence involving only measured variables in specific manners. Experimental results show that our method effectively recovers the causal structure, even when latent variables are influenced by measured variables.",

Canonical OOD bounds focus on different distance measurements between source and target domains but fail to consider the optimization property of the learned model. As empirically shown in recent work, the sharpness of learned minima influences OOD generalization. To bridge this gap between optimization and OOD generalization, we study the effect of sharpness on how a model tolerates data change in domain shift which is usually captured by \"robustness\" in generalization. In this paper, we give a rigorous connection between sharpness and robustness, which gives better OOD guarantees for robust algorithms.

        "abstract": "Generative models have shown remarkable progress in 3D aspect. Recent works learn 3D representation explicitly under text-3D guidance. However, limited text3D data restricts the vocabulary scale and text control of generations. Generators may easily fall into a stereotype concept for certain text prompts, thus losing openvocabulary generation ability. To tackle this issue, we introduce a conditional 3D generative model, namely TextField3D.Specifically, rather than using the text prompts as input directly, we suggest to inject dynamic noise into the latent space of given text prompts, i.e., Noisy Text Fields (NTFs). In this way, limited 3D data can be mapped to the appropriate range of textual latent space that is expanded by NTFs. To this end, an NTFGen module is proposed to model general text latent code in noisy fields. Meanwhile, an NTFBind module is proposed to align viewinvariant image latent code to noisy fields, further supporting image-conditional 3D generation. To guide the conditional generation in both geometry and texture, multi-modal discrimination is constructed with a text-3D discriminator and a text2.5D discriminator. Compared to previous methods, TextField3D includes three merits: 1) large vocabulary, 2) text consistency, and 3) low latency.

        "abstract": "Despite many successful examples in which probabilistic inference can account for perception, we have little understanding of how the brain represents and uses structured priors that capture the complexity of natural input statistics. Here we construct a recurrent circuit model that can implicitly represent priors over latent variables, and combine them with sensory and contextual sources of information to encode task-specific posteriors. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models as means of learning and using priors over images, our model uses dendritic nonlinearities optimized for denoising, and stochastic somatic integration with the degree of noise modulated by an oscillating global signal. Combining these elements into a recurrent network yields a dynamical system that samples from the prior at a rate prescribed by the period of the global oscillator. Additional inputs reflecting sensory or top-down contextual information alter these dynamics to generate samples from the corresponding posterior, with different input gating patterns selecting different inference tasks. We demonstrate that this architecture can sample from low dimensional nonlinear manifolds and multimodal posteriors. Overall, the model provides a new framework for circuit-level representation of probabilistic information, in a format that facilitates flexible inference.",

Recent studies have extended Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to manifolds, and concomitantly, normalization techniques have also been adapted to several manifolds, referred to as Riemannian normalization. Nonetheless, most of the existing Riemannian normalization methods have been derived in an ad hoc manner and only apply to specific manifolds. This paper establishes a unified framework for Riemannian Batch Normalization (RBN) techniques on Lie groups. Our framework offers the theoretical guarantee of controlling both the Riemannian mean and variance. Empirically, we focus on Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifolds, which possess three distinct types of Lie group structures. Using the deformation concept, we generalize the existing Lie groups on SPD manifolds into three families of parameterized Lie groups. Specific normalization layers induced by these Lie groups are then proposed for SPD neural networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through three sets of experiments: radar recognition, human action recognition, and electroencephalography (EEG) classification.

        "abstract": "Hypernetworks, neural networks that predict the parameters of another neural network, are powerful models that have been successfully used in diverse applications from image generation to multi-task learning. Unfortunately, existing hypernetworks are often challenging to train. Training typically converges far more slowly than for non-hypernetwork models, and the rate of convergence can be very sensitive to hyperparameter choices. In this work, we identify a fundamental and previously unidentified problem that contributes to the challenge of training hypernetworks: a magnitude proportionality between the inputs and outputs of the hypernetwork. We demonstrate both analytically and empirically that this can lead to unstable optimization, thereby slowing down convergence, and sometimes even preventing any learning. We present a simple solution to this problem using a revised hypernetwork formulation that we call Magnitude Invariant Parametrizations (MIP). We demonstrate the proposed solution on several hypernetwork tasks, where it consistently stabilizes training and achieves faster convergence. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive ablation study including choices of activation function, normalization strategies, input dimensionality, and hypernetwork architecture; and find that MIP improves training in all scenarios. We also provide easy-to-use code that can turn existing networks into MIP-based hypernetworks.",

In response, Data-Free Knowledge Distillation (DFKD) methods have emerged as direct solutions.

        "abstract": "Despite the advancements of open-source large language models (LLMs), e.g., LLaMA, they remain significantly limited in tool-use capabilities, i.e., using external tools (APIs) to fulfill human instructions. The reason is that current instruction tuning largely focuses on basic language tasks but ignores the tool-use domain. This is in contrast to the excellent tool-use capabilities of state-of-the-art (SOTA) closed-source LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT. To bridge this gap, we introduce ToolLLM, a general tool-use framework encompassing data construction, model training, and evaluation. We first present ToolBench, an instruction-tuning dataset for tool use, which is constructed automatically using ChatGPT. Specifically, the construction can be divided into three stages: (i) API collection: we collect 16, 464 real-world RESTful APIs spanning 49 categories from RapidAPI Hub; (ii) instruction generation: we prompt ChatGPT to generate diverse instructions involving these APIs, covering both single-tool and multi-tool scenarios; (iii) solution path annotation: we use ChatGPT to search for a valid solution path (chain of API calls) for each instruction. To enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we develop a novel depth-first search-based decision tree algorithm. It enables LLMs to evaluate multiple reasoning traces and expand the search space. Moreover, to evaluate the tool-use capabilities of LLMs, we develop an automatic evaluator: ToolEval. Based on ToolBench, we fine-tune LLaMA to obtain an LLM ToolLLaMA, and equip it with a neural API retriever to recommend appropriate APIs for each instruction. Experiments show that ToolLLaMA demonstrates a remarkable ability to execute complex instructions and generalize to unseen APIs, and exhibits comparable performance to ChatGPT. Our ToolLLaMA also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization ability in an out-of-distribution tool-use dataset: APIBench.

While high-quality images naturally result in more precise detection and classification, they also result in a heavier computational workload for imaging and processing, reduced camera frame rates, and increased data communication between the camera and processor. Taking inspiration from the foveal-peripheral sampling mechanism, and saccade mechanism of the human visual system and the filling-in phenomena of brain, we have developed an active scene reconstruction architecture based on multiple foveal views. This model stitches together information from a sequence of foveal-peripheral views, which are sampled from multiple glances. Assisted by a reinforcement learning-based saccade mechanism, our model reduces the required input pixels by over 90% per frame while maintaining the same level of performance in image recognition as with the original images. We evaluated the effectiveness of our model using the GTSRB dataset and the ImageNet dataset. Using an equal number of input pixels, our model demonstrates a 5% higher image recognition accuracy compared to state-of-theart foveal-peripheral based vision systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our foveal sampling/saccadic scene reconstruction model exhibits significantly lower complexity and higher data efficiency during the training phase compared to existing approaches.

        "peer_review_with_watermark": "## Peer Review\n\n## Paper Summary\n\nThis paper introduces a novel method for calculating calibration error known as Smooth ECE (Expected Calibration Error), which aligns with the calibration measure defined by B\u0142asiok et al. (2023). Smooth ECE is a smooth function of the prediction distribution that behaves well and can be illustrated in a reliability diagram. The authors also propose a systematic approach for selecting the bandwidth of the kernel smoothing, which is essential for calculating the Smooth ECE.\n\n## Strengths\n\n* Smooth ECE is a reliable and consistent measure for calibration that can evaluate the effectiveness of probabilistic predictors.\n* A systematic method for choosing the bandwidth for kernel smoothing is presented, which is crucial to the Smooth ECE calculation.\n* Smooth ECE is compatible with visual representation in reliability diagrams, aiding in the interpretation of prediction error.\n* The authors have developed a Python package that effectively executes the Smooth ECE calculations.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n* The calculation of Smooth ECE is relatively intricate, necessitating the selection of a bandwidth parameter, which may pose practical difficulties.\n* Smooth ECE is specifically tailored for binary prediction issues, potentially restricting its use in broader prediction contexts.\n* There is a lack of thorough examination regarding how the Smooth ECE calculation responds to variations in predictor distribution.\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n* The authors could enhance their analysis concerning the sensitivity of Smooth ECE to shifts in the predictor distribution.\n* A more efficient algorithm for determining the bandwidth parameter could simplify the Smooth ECE calculation.\n* Expanding the scope of Smooth ECE to accommodate a wider range of prediction problems would be beneficial.\n\n## Recommendation\n\nIn summary, the Smooth ECE presents a well-structured and reliable measure for calibration, serving as a valuable tool for gauging the dependability of probabilistic predictors. Despite certain limitations, the authors offer a methodical way to select the bandwidth parameter and have created a Python package for efficient computation. Given the quality of this work, I recommend accepting the Smooth ECE for publication.\n\nRating: 8/10\n\nRevision Comments:\n- Include a more comprehensive analysis of how the Smooth ECE is affected by changes in the predictor distribution.\n- Provide thorough guidelines on how to practically implement the Smooth ECE calculation.\n- Consider modifications to the Smooth ECE calculation to allow for broader applicability in different prediction scenarios.\n\n## Appendix\n\nPlease submit the complete version of the Appendix as reviewers feel the current iteration is too concise.",

        "abstract": "We seek to uncover the latent interest units from behavioral data to better learn user preferences under the VAE framework. Existing practices tend to ignore the multiple facets of item characteristics, which may not capture it at appropriate granularity. Moreover, current studies equate the granularity of item space to that of user interests, which we postulate is not ideal as user interests would likely map to a small subset of item space. In addition, the compositionality of user interests has received inadequate attention, preventing the modeling of interactions between explanatory factors driving a user\u2019s decision. To resolve this, we propose to align user interests with multi-faceted item characteristics. First, we involve prototype-based representation learning to discover item characteristics along multiple facets. Second, we compose user interests from uncovered item characteristics via binding mechanism, separating the granularity of user preferences from that of item space. Third, we design a dedicated bi-directional binding block, aiding the derivation of compositional user interests. On real-world datasets, the experimental results demonstrate the strong performance of our proposed method compared to a series of baselines.",
        "peer_review_without_watermark": "$$$Paper Summary:\nThe paper proposes a novel approach to disentangled representation learning for recommendation systems, called FACETVAE. FACETVAE addresses the shortcomings of existing VAE-based models by disentangling item space under multiple facets, binding compositional user interests from low-level ones, and effectively binding user interests via a bi-directional binding block. The proposed method is evaluated on three real-world datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate its strong performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines.\n\nStrengths:\n1. FACETVAE addresses the limitations of existing VAE-based models by disentangling item space under multiple facets, which improves the modeling of user interests.\n2. The proposed method effectively binds compositional user interests from low-level ones discovered from item space, which enhances the interpretability of user preferences.\n3. The bi-directional binding block is a novel component that enables the competition between low-level interests to attend to high-level counterparts, which improves the diversity of user interests.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. The computational cost of FACETVAE is higher than that of some baselines, which may be a limitation in practice.\n2. The evaluation of FACETVAE on some datasets may be biased due to the limited number of prototypes used to group items.\n\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n1. To improve the efficiency of multi-faceted item grouping, the authors could explore more efficient algorithms or techniques for grouping items under multiple facets.\n2. To discover the number of facets and the number of clusters per facet in a data-driven manner, the authors could develop more sophisticated methods for facet discovery and clustering.\n\nRecommendation:\nI recommend accepting the paper for publication in its current form. The proposed method, FACETVAE, has the potential to improve the performance of recommendation systems, and its contributions to the field of disentangled representation learning are significant. With some minor revisions to address the limitations mentioned above, the paper can provide valuable insights and inspiration for future research in the field.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel defense against backdoor attacks on deep neural networks (DNNs), wherein adversaries covertly implant malicious behaviors (backdoors) into DNNs. Our defense falls within the category of post-development defenses that operate independently of how the model was generated. Our proposed defense is built upon an intriguing concept: given a backdoored model, we reverse engineer it to directly extract its backdoor functionality to a backdoor expert model. To accomplish this, we finetune the backdoored model over a small set of intentionally mislabeled clean samples, such that it unlearns the normal functionality while still preserving the backdoor functionality, and thus resulting in a model (dubbed a backdoor expert model) that can only recognize backdoor inputs. Based on the extracted backdoor expert model, we show the feasibility of devising robust backdoor input detectors that filter out the backdoor inputs during model inference. Further augmented by an ensemble strategy with a finetuned auxiliary model, our defense, BaDExpert (Backdoor Input Detection with Backdoor Expert), effectively mitigates 17 SOTA backdoor attacks while minimally impacting clean utility. The effectiveness of BaDExpert has been verified on multiple datasets (CIFAR10, GTSRB, and ImageNet) across multiple model architectures (ResNet, VGG, MobileNetV2, and Vision Transformer).

However, most existing open-vocabulary detectors learn by aligning region embeddings with categorical labels (e.g., bicycle) only, disregarding the capability of VLMs on aligning visual embeddings with fine-grained text description of object parts (e.g., pedals and bells). This paper presents DVDet, a Descriptor-Enhanced Open Vocabulary Detector that introduces conditional context prompts and hierarchical textual descriptors that enable precise region-text alignment as well as open-vocabulary detection training in general. Specifically, the conditional context prompt transforms regional embeddings into image-like representations that can be directly integrated into general open vocabulary detection training.

        "abstract": "Deep long-tailed recognition (DLTR) has attracted much attention due to its close touch with realistic scenarios. Recent advances have focused on re-balancing across various aspects, e.g., sampling strategy, loss re-weighting, logit adjustment, and input/parameter perturbation, etc. However, few studies have considered dynamic re-balancing to address intrinsic optimization conflicts, which are identified as prevalent and critical issues in this study. In this paper, we empirically establish the severity of the optimization conflict issue in the DLTR scenario, which leads to a degradation of representation learning. This observation serves as the motivation for pursuing Pareto optimal solutions. Unfortunately, a straightforward integration of multi-objective optimization (MOO) with DLTR methods is infeasible due to the disparity between multi-task learning (MTL) and DLTR. Therefore, we propose effective alternatives by decoupling MOO-based MTL from a temporal perspective rather than a structural one. Furthermore, we enhance the integration of MOO and DLTR by investigating the generalization and convergence problems. Specifically, we propose optimizing the variability collapse loss, guided by the derived MOObased DLTR generalization bound, to improve generalization. Additionally, we anticipate worst-case optimization to ensure convergence. Building upon the proposed MOO framework, we introduce a novel method called Pareto deep LOngTailed recognition (PLOT). Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method not only generally improves mainstream pipelines, but also achieves an augmented version to realize state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

        "title": "RAIN: YOUR LANGUAGE MODELS CAN ALIGN THEMSELVES",
        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) often demonstrate inconsistencies with human preferences. Previous research typically gathered human preference data and then aligned the pre-trained models using reinforcement learning or instruction tuning, a.k.a. the finetuning step. In contrast, aligning frozen LLMs without requiring alignment data is more appealing. This work explores the potential of the latter setting. We discover that by integrating self-evaluation and rewind mechanisms, unaligned LLMs can directly produce responses consistent with human preferences via self-boosting. We introduce a novel inference method, Rewindable Auto-regressive INference (RAIN), that allows pre-trained LLMs to evaluate their own generation and use the evaluation results to guide rewind and generation for AI safety. Notably, RAIN operates without the need of extra data for model alignment and abstains from any training, gradient computation, or parameter updates. Experimental results evaluated by GPT-4 and humans demonstrate the effectiveness of RAIN: on the HH dataset, RAIN improves the harmlessness rate of LLaMA 30B from 82% of vanilla inference to 97%, while maintaining the helpfulness rate. On the TruthfulQA dataset, RAIN improves the truthfulness of the already-well-aligned LLaMA-2-chat 13B model by 5%. The code is available at https://github.com/SafeAILab/RAIN.",

The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the RAIN method, making it easy to understand and implement.\n3. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of RAIN in improving the harmlessness rate and truthfulness of LLMs.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1.

        "peer_review_with_watermark": "$$$ Paper Summary:\nThis paper introduces a new approach for aligning frozen large language models (LLMs) without the need for finetuning. The approach, named Rewindable Auto-regressive INference (RAIN), incorporates self-evaluation and rewind mechanisms into the generation stage. RAIN allows LLMs to generate responses that align with human preferences. The paper assesses RAIN across multiple datasets and compares it to current alignment methods. Findings indicate that RAIN enhances the harmlessness rate of LLMs while preserving the helpfulness rate. RAIN is also compared to other alignment strategies, such as RLHF and RLAIF, which involve finetuning and labeled data. RAIN demonstrates comparable effectiveness but shows advantages in resource efficiency.\n\nStrengths:\n1. RAIN is an innovative approach for aligning frozen LLMs without the need for finetuning, providing a major benefit in terms of resource efficiency.\n2. RAIN employs self-evaluation and rewind mechanisms during the generation phase, which allows LLMs to produce responses that are in line with human preferences.\n3. As a plug-in method, RAIN can be easily incorporated into existing LLMs, offering a flexible solution for aligning LLMs in various contexts.\n4. The evaluation of RAIN on different datasets, along with comparisons to existing alignment methods, provides a thorough assessment of its effectiveness.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. As a relatively new method, RAIN may not have fully understood limitations or potential biases.\n2. RAIN might face challenges in terms of effectiveness for LLMs with a high number of parameters, as it could be computationally demanding and resource-heavy.\n3. RAIN may not perform as well for LLMs with complex architectures, as it might require a deeper understanding of the model's internal mechanisms.\n\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n1. Additional experimentation is needed to explore the limitations and potential biases associated with RAIN.\n2. Incorporating other alignment techniques may enhance RAIN's overall effectiveness.\n3. A more comprehensive understanding of how RAIN interacts with LLMs of varying architectures and parameter counts could be beneficial.\n\nRecommendation:\nThe paper introduces a distinctive method for aligning frozen LLMs without finetuning. RAIN appears to be a promising approach for aligning LLMs in diverse settings, yet it is essential to conduct further experimental evaluations to clarify its effectiveness and potential biases. I recommend utilizing RAIN as a plug-in alignment method for scenarios where finetuning is not feasible or requires considerable resources.",

However, like other generative models, diffusion models are prone to privacy issues. In this paper, we propose an efficient query-based membership inference attack (MIA), namely Proximal Initialization Attack (PIA), which utilizes groundtruth trajectory obtained by \u03b5 initialized in t = 0 and predicted point to infer memberships. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can achieve competitive performance with only two queries that achieve at least 6\u00d7 efficiency than the previous SOTA baseline on both discrete-time and continuous-time diffusion models. Moreover, previous works on the privacy of diffusion models have focused on vision tasks without considering audio tasks. Therefore, we also explore the robustness of diffusion models to MIA in the text-tospeech (TTS) task, which is an audio generation task. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to study the robustness of diffusion models to MIA in the TTS task. Experimental results indicate that models with mel-spectrogram (image-like) output are vulnerable to MIA, while models with audio output are relatively robust to MIA.

While existing FR algorithms primarily focus on optimizing margins and loss functions, limited attention has been given to exploring the feature representation space. Therefore, this paper endeavors to improve FR performance in the view of feature representation space. Firstly, we consider two FR models that exhibit distinct performance discrepancies, where one model exhibits superior recognition accuracy compared to the other. We implement orthogonal decomposition on the features from the superior model along those from the inferior model and obtain two sub-features. Surprisingly, we find the sub-feature orthogonal to the inferior still possesses a certain level of face distinguishability. We adjust the modulus of the sub-features and recombine them through vector addition. Experiments demonstrate this recombination is likely to contribute to an improved facial feature representation, even better than features from the original superior model. Motivated by this discovery, we further consider how to improve FR accuracy when there is only one FR model available. Inspired by knowledge distillation, we incorporate the intraclass incoherence constraint (IIC) to solve the problem. Experiments on various FR benchmarks show the existing state-of-the-art method with IIC can be further improved, highlighting its potential to further enhance FR performance.",

        "abstract": "Graph transformers (GTs) have emerged as a promising architecture that is theoretically more expressive than message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs). However, typical GT models have at least quadratic complexity and thus cannot scale to large graphs. While there are several linear GTs recently proposed, they still lag behind GNN counterparts on several popular graph datasets, which poses a critical concern on their practical expressivity. To balance the trade-off between expressivity and scalability of GTs, we propose Polynormer, a polynomialexpressive GT model with linear complexity. Polynormer is built upon a novel base model that learns a high-degree polynomial on input features. To enable the base model permutation equivariant, we integrate it with graph topology and node features separately, resulting in local and global equivariant attention models. Consequently, Polynormer adopts a linear local-to-global attention scheme to learn high-degree equivariant polynomials whose coefficients are controlled by attention scores. Polynormer has been evaluated on 13 homophilic and heterophilic datasets, including large graphs with millions of nodes. Our extensive experiment results show that Polynormer outperforms state-of-the-art GNN and GT baselines on most datasets, even without the use of nonlinear activation functions.

Most existing methods devote the referring head to localize the referred object directly, causing failure in complex scenarios. In addition, it does not illustrate how and why the network reaches the final decision. In this paper, we address this question \u201cCan we design an interpretable 3D visual grounding framework that has the potential to mimic the human perception system?\u201d. To this end, we formulate the 3D visual grounding problem as a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) task by first predicting a chain of anchors and then the final target. Interpretability not only improves the overall performance but also helps us identify failure cases. Following the chain of thoughts approach enables us to decompose the referring task into interpretable intermediate steps, boosting the performance and making our framework extremely data-efficient. Moreover, our proposed framework can be easily integrated into any existing architecture. We validate our approach through comprehensive experiments on the Nr3D, Sr3D, and Scanrefer benchmarks and show consistent performance gains compared to existing methods without requiring manually annotated data. Furthermore, our proposed framework, dubbed CoT3DRef, is significantly data-efficient, whereas on the Sr3D dataset, when trained only on 10% of the data, we match the SOTA performance that trained on the entire data.

In this paper, we consider the generalization where other agents or external events also intervene on the system, which is key for enabling adaptiveness to non-stationarities such as weather changes, market forces, or adversaries. We formalize this generalization of CBO as Adversarial Causal Bayesian Optimization (ACBO) and introduce the first algorithm for ACBO with bounded regret: Causal Bayesian Optimization with Multiplicative Weights (CBO-MW). Our approach combines a classical online learning strategy with causal modeling of the rewards. To achieve this, it computes optimistic counterfactual reward estimates by propagating uncertainty through the causal graph. We derive regret bounds for CBO-MW that naturally depend on graph-related quantities. We further propose a scalable implementation for the case of combinatorial interventions and submodular rewards.

These models are developed using a unique instruction-tuning dataset called MathInstruct, which integrates a distinctive combination of chain-of-thought (CoT) and program-of-thought (PoT) rationales, allowing for extensive coverage across various math disciplines and complexity levels. The proposed method demonstrates a substantial improvement over current open-source models on mathematical reasoning datasets, achieving notable accuracy enhancements, particularly with out-of-domain datasets.\n\n\\section{Strengths}\nA key advantage of this approach is the creation of the innovative instruction-tuning dataset, MathInstruct, which effectively overcomes the shortcomings of existing datasets. The integration of hybrid CoT and PoT rationales within the dataset allows the model to engage with a broader spectrum of mathematical problem-solving situations, enhancing its versatility as a generalist model. Moreover, MAmmoTH's ability to surpass existing open-source models highlights its potential as a practical solution for enhancing mathematical reasoning in large language models.\n\n\\section{Weaknesses}\nHowever, one potential drawback of this approach is its requirement for a substantial amount of data, which could restrict its applicability to smaller datasets or models with lower computational demands. Another possible limitation is its dependency on the newly developed instruction-tuning dataset, which might not generalize as effectively as more established datasets. Additionally, further investigation into the influence of PoT and CoT ratios could be beneficial, given their potential interactions with other elements like data quality or model architecture.\n\n\\section{Suggestions for Improvement}\nTo mitigate these challenges, it could be advantageous to assess MAmmoTH with smaller datasets or less computationally-intensive models to better evaluate its generalizability and practicality across diverse situations. Additionally, investigating the effects of PoT and CoT ratios may provide insights into their complex interactions with other factors, thereby enhancing the understanding and potential refinement of MAmmoTH. Lastly, conducting a more comprehensive analysis of MAmmoTH's performance across a broader array of mathematical problem-solving contexts could yield important insights into its generalization capabilities.\n\n\\section{Recommendation}\nIn light of the findings presented, MAmmoTH shows promise as a robust solution for enhancing mathematical reasoning abilities in large language models. Its superior performance compared to existing open-source models, especially on out-of-domain datasets, indicates its viability across various scenarios. Nonetheless, further examination of its limitations, such as data quality and generalization capabilities, will be essential to comprehensively grasp its strengths and weaknesses.

Therefore, text-conditioned video prediction (TVP) is an essential task to facilitate general robot policy learning. To tackle this task and empower robots with the ability to foresee the future, we propose a sample and computation-efficient model, named Seer, by inflating the pretrained text-toimage (T2I) stable diffusion models along the temporal axis. We enhance the U-Net and language conditioning model by incorporating computation-efficient spatial-temporal attention. Furthermore, we introduce a novel Frame Sequential Text Decomposer module that dissects a sentence\u2019s global instruction into temporally aligned sub-instructions, ensuring precise integration into each frame of generation. Our framework allows us to effectively leverage the extensive prior knowledge embedded in pretrained T2I models across the frames.

The approach is simple, generic, and obtains promising results across multiple domains.\n\nStrengths:\n\n1. The proposed approach, Conv-LoRA, is simple and generic, making it a promising method for adapting SAM to various downstream segmentation applications.\n2. Conv-LoRA leverages the strengths of LoRA, a popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach, to inject image-related local prior knowledge into the ViT encoder.\n3. The approach is effective in boosting the segmentation performance, especially in domains where SAM's pretraining is limited.\n4. The authors provide extensive experimentation across diverse benchmarks, showcasing the robustness and effectiveness of Conv-LoRA.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n1. The paper does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the limitations of SAM's pretraining in specialized domains, which might limit its generalization to these domains.\n2.

The authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the limitations of SAM's pretraining in specialized domains and discuss potential ways to address these limitations.\n2. The approach could be further improved by incorporating additional techniques, such as multi-scale attention or spatial attention, to better capture high-level semantic information.\n3.

However, further improvements are needed to address the limitations and weaknesses identified in the paper. Specifically, the authors should provide a more detailed analysis of SAM's pretraining limitations, incorporate additional techniques to improve the approach, and provide a more comprehensive evaluation of Conv-LoRA's computational and memory overhead.

As a result, PIXART-\u03b1\u2019s training speed markedly surpasses existing large-scale T2I models, e.g., PIXART\u03b1 only takes 12% of Stable Diffusion v1.5\u2019s training time (\u223c753 vs. \u223c6,250 A100 GPU days), saving nearly $300,000 ($28,400 vs. $320,000) and reducing 90% CO2 emissions.

To resolve these issues, we take a two-step approach. First, we design an algorithmic framework consisting of a generic federated LCB algorithm and flexible privacy protocols. Then, leveraging the proposed framework, we study federated LCBs under two different privacy constraints. We first establish privacy and regret guarantees under silo-level local differential privacy, which fix the issues present in state-of-the-art algorithm.

        "abstract": "Deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial attacks, which can compromise their performance and accuracy. Adversarial Training (AT) has emerged as a popular approach for protecting neural networks against such attacks. However, a key challenge of AT is robust overfitting, where the network\u2019s robust performance on test data deteriorates with further training, thus hindering generalization. Motivated by the concept of active forgetting in the brain, we introduce a novel learning paradigm called \u201cForget to Mitigate Overfitting (FOMO)\". FOMO alternates between the forgetting phase, which randomly forgets a subset of weights and regulates the model\u2019s information through weight reinitialization, and the relearning phase, which emphasizes learning generalizable features. Our experiments on benchmark datasets and adversarial attacks show that FOMO alleviates robust overfitting by significantly reducing the gap between the best and last robust test accuracy while improving the state-of-the-art robustness. Furthermore, FOMO provides a better trade-off between standard and robust accuracy, outperforming baseline adversarial methods. Finally, our framework is robust to AutoAttacks and increases generalization in many real-world scenarios.1",

Since the seminal works devoted to EBMs dating back to the noughties, there have been a lot of efficient methods which solve the generative modelling problem by means of energy potentials (unnormalized likelihood functions). In contrast, the realm of Optimal Transport (OT) and, in particular, neural OT solvers is much less explored and limited by few recent works (excluding WGAN-based approaches which utilize OT as a loss function and do not model OT maps themselves). In our work, we bridge the gap between EBMs and Entropy-regularized OT. We present a novel methodology which allows utilizing the recent developments and technical improvements of the former in order to enrich the latter. From the theoretical perspective, we prove generalization bounds for our technique. In practice, we validate its applicability in toy 2D and image domains. To showcase the scalability, we empower our method with a pre-trained StyleGAN and apply it to high-res AFHQ 512 \u00d7 512 unpaired I2I translation.

The main challenge is how to distinguish high-quality pseudo labels against the confirmation bias. However, existing pseudo-label selection strategies are limited to pre-defined schemes or complex hand-crafted policies specially designed for classification, failing to achieve high-quality labels, fast convergence, and task versatility simultaneously. To these ends, we propose a Semi-supervised Reward framework (SemiReward) that predicts reward scores to evaluate and filter out high-quality pseudo labels, which is pluggable to mainstream SSL methods in wide task types and scenarios. To mitigate confirmation bias, SemiReward is trained online in two stages with a generator model and subsampling strategy. With classification and regression tasks on 13 standard SSL benchmarks across three modalities, extensive experiments verify that SemiReward achieves significant performance gains and faster convergence speeds upon Pseudo Label, FlexMatch, and Free/SoftMatch.

        "abstract": "Relying on prior knowledge accumulated from related tasks, meta-learning offers a powerful approach to learning a novel task from limited training data. Recent approaches parameterize the prior with a family of probability density functions or recurrent neural networks, whose parameters can be optimized by utilizing validation data from the observed tasks. While these approaches have appealing empirical performance, the expressiveness of their prior is relatively low, which limits the generalization and interpretation of meta-learning. Aiming at expressive yet meaningful priors, this contribution puts forth a novel prior representation model that leverages the notion of algorithm unrolling. The key idea is to unroll the proximal gradient descent steps, where learnable piecewise linear functions are developed to approximate the desired proximal operators within tight theoretical error bounds established for both smooth and non-smooth proximal functions. The resultant multi-block neural network not only broadens the scope of learnable priors, but also enhances interpretability from an optimization viewpoint. Numerical tests conducted on few-shot learning datasets demonstrate markedly improved performance with flexible, visualizable, and understandable priors.",

Although SSL has been proven effective in speech and audio, its application to music audio has yet to be thoroughly explored. This is partially due to the distinctive challenges associated with modelling musical knowledge, particularly tonal and pitched characteristics of music. To address this research gap, we propose an acoustic Music undERstanding model with large-scale self-supervised Training (MERT), which incorporates teacher models to provide pseudo labels in the masked language modelling (MLM) style acoustic pre-training. In our exploration, we identified an effective combination of teacher models, which outperforms conventional speech and audio approaches in terms of performance. This combination includes an acoustic teacher based on Residual Vector Quantisation Variational AutoEncoder (RVQ-VAE) and a musical teacher based on the ConstantQ Transform (CQT). Furthermore, we explore a wide range of settings to overcome the instability in acoustic language model pre-training, which allows our designed paradigm to scale from 95M to 330M parameters. Experimental results indicate that our model can generalise and perform well on 14 music understanding tasks and attain state-of-the-art (SOTA) overall scores.",

Although it encounters some limitations, its strengths render it a compelling choice for researchers and practitioners looking to enhance music understanding capabilities. To further enhance MERT, we suggest exploring different pre-training strategies to tackle training instability and enabling it to train on longer audio snippets to resolve the short context issue.

Beyond the problem formulation of traditional sorting algorithms, we consider sorting problems for more abstract yet expressive inputs, e.g., multi-digit images and image fragments, through a neural sorting network. To learn a mapping from a high-dimensional input to an ordinal variable, the differentiability of sorting networks needs to be guaranteed. In this paper we define a softening error by a differentiable swap function, and develop an error-free swap function that holds a non-decreasing condition and differentiability. Furthermore, a permutation-equivariant Transformer network with multi-head attention is adopted to capture dependency between given inputs and also leverage its model capacity with self-attention.

        "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the potential of Lipschitz-based methods for training certifiably robust neural networks against adversarial attacks. A key challenge, supported both theoretically and empirically, is that robustness demands greater network capacity and more data than standard training. However, effectively adding capacity under stringent Lipschitz constraints has proven more difficult than it may seem, evident by the fact that state-of-the-art approach tend more towards underfitting than overfitting. Moreover, we posit that a lack of careful exploration of the design space for Lipshitz-based approaches has left potential performance gains on the table. In this work, we provide a more comprehensive evaluation to better uncover the potential of Lipschitz-based certification methods. Using a combination of novel techniques, design optimizations, and synthesis of prior work, we are able to significantly improve the state-of-the-art VRA for deterministic certification on a variety of benchmark datasets, and over a range of perturbation sizes. Of particular note, we discover that the addition of large \u201cCholesky-orthogonalized residual dense\u201d layers to the end of existing state-of-the-art Lipschitz-controlled ResNet architectures is especially effective for increasing network capacity and performance.

Although widespread, using Laplacian eigenvectors as positional encodings faces two fundamental challenges: (1) Non-uniqueness: there are many different eigendecompositions of the same Laplacian, and (2) Instability: small perturbations to the Laplacian could result in completely different eigenspaces, leading to unpredictable changes in positional encoding. Despite many attempts to address nonuniqueness, most methods overlook stability, leading to poor generalization on unseen graph structures. We identify the cause of instability to be a \u201chard partition\u201d of eigenspaces. Hence, we introduce Stable and Expressive Positional Encodings (SPE), an architecture for processing eigenvectors that uses eigenvalues to \u201csoftly partition\u201d eigenspaces. SPE is the first architecture that is (1) provably stable, and (2) universally expressive for basis invariant functions whilst respecting all symmetries of eigenvectors.

        "abstract": "The application of machine learning (ML) in a range of geospatial tasks is increasingly common but often relies on globally available covariates such as satellite imagery that can either be expensive or lack predictive power. Here we explore the question of whether the vast amounts of knowledge found in Internet language corpora, now compressed within large language models (LLMs), can be leveraged for geospatial prediction tasks. We first demonstrate that LLMs embed remarkable spatial information about locations, but naively querying LLMs using geographic coordinates alone is ineffective in predicting key indicators like population density. We then present GeoLLM, a novel method that can effectively extract geospatial knowledge from LLMs with auxiliary map data from OpenStreetMap. We demonstrate the utility of our approach across multiple tasks of central interest to the international community, including the measurement of population density and economic livelihoods. Across these tasks, our method demonstrates a 70% improvement in performance (measured using Pearson\u2019s r) relative to baselines that use nearest neighbors or use information directly from the prompt, and performance equal to or exceeding satellite-based benchmarks in the literature. With GeoLLM, we observe that GPT-3.5 outperforms Llama 2 and RoBERTa by 19% and 51% respectively, suggesting that the performance of our method scales well with the size of the model and its pretraining dataset. Our experiments reveal that LLMs are remarkably sample-efficient, rich in geospatial information, and robust across the globe.

        "abstract": "The key challenge in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era is finding useful circuits compatible with current device limitations. Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) offer a potential solution by fixing the circuit architecture and optimizing individual gate parameters in an external loop. However, parameter optimization can become intractable, and the overall performance of the algorithm depends heavily on the initially chosen circuit architecture. Several quantum architecture search (QAS) algorithms have been developed to design useful circuit architectures automatically. In the case of parameter optimization alone, noise effects have been observed to dramatically influence the performance of the optimizer and final outcomes, which is a key line of study. However, the effects of noise on the architecture search, which could be just as critical, are poorly understood. This work addresses this gap by introducing a curriculum-based reinforcement learning QAS (CRLQAS) algorithm designed to tackle challenges in realistic VQA deployment. The algorithm incorporates (i) a 3D architecture encoding and restrictions on environment dynamics to explore the search space of possible circuits efficiently, (ii) an episode halting scheme to steer the agent to find shorter circuits, and (iii) a novel variant of simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation as an optimizer for faster convergence. To facilitate studies, we developed an optimized simulator for our algorithm, significantly improving computational efficiency in simulating noisy quantum circuits by employing the Pauli-transfer matrix formalism in the Pauli-Liouville basis. Numerical experiments focusing on quantum chemistry tasks demonstrate that CRLQAS outperforms existing QAS algorithms across several metrics in both noiseless and noisy environments.",

The algorithm achieves state-of-the-art results in the quantum architecture search (QAS) sub-field by obtaining the ground-state energy within the bounds of chemical accuracy while proposing circuits characterized by low gate counts and depths.\n\nStrengths: \n1. The CRLQAS algorithm adeptly addresses the specific challenges associated with deploying VQE in realistic noisy quantum conditions through a curriculum-based learning approach, enabling the agent to dynamically adjust to varying problem complexities.\n2. The inclusion of illegal actions, random halting, and the novel version of the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation algorithm improves the algorithm\u2019s efficiency and robustness.\n3. The substantial six-fold acceleration gained by using the Pauli-transfer matrix (PTM) formalism in the Pauli-Liouville basis supports the simulation of realistic noisy quantum circuits, enhancing the algorithm's applicability to actual quantum hardware.\n\nWeaknesses: \n1.

The experiments on the LiH\u22126 molecule did not achieve chemical accuracy, indicating a need for further exploration of the algorithm's robustness under extreme noise conditions.\n3.

Carry out comprehensive hyperparameter tuning to enhance the CRLQAS algorithm\u2019s performance, ensuring robustness across different quantum noise scenarios.\n2. Examine the robustness of the CRLQAS algorithm against severe noise, as shown in the LiH\u22126 experiments, by employing additional noise models or robust optimization techniques.\n3. Perform comparative studies of CRLQAS with current QAS algorithms, such as quantumDARTS, qubit-ADAPT-VQE, and QCAS, to validate CRLQAS's superior performance in various quantum chemistry tasks.\n\nRecommendation: \nThis paper illustrates the CRLQAS algorithm's effectiveness in overcoming the challenges of deploying VQE in realistic noisy quantum environments, achieving leading performance in the QAS sub-field. However, further exploration into the algorithm's robustness, hyperparameter tuning, and comparative research against other QAS algorithms is essential to fully realize the potential of CRLQAS.\n\nThe authors' capabilities in addressing the unique challenges related to deploying VQE in realistic noisy quantum environments, the inclusion of illegal actions, random halting, and the innovative variant of the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation method, along with the notable six-fold increase in efficiency brought about by the PTM formalism, make CRLQAS a promising method for real-world quantum hardware.\n\nNevertheless, the lack of chemical accuracy in the experiments involving the LiH\u22126 molecule underscores the requirement for additional investigation into the algorithm's robustness under severe noise and highlights the importance of thorough hyperparameter tuning to optimize CRLQAS's performance.\n\nEnd of Review: \n\n$$",

While learning-based methods achieve state-of-the-art performance on existing benchmarks, they generalize poorly to in-the-wild images. Such methods typically need to train separate models for different scene types (e.g., indoor vs. outdoor) and are impractical when the scene type is unknown in advance. One of the underlying problems is the limited scalability of existing data construction pipelines, which limits the diversity of standard image matching datasets. To address this problem, we propose GIM, a self-training framework for learning a single generalizable model based on any image matching architecture using internet videos, an abundant and diverse data source. Given an architecture, GIM first trains it on standard domain-specific datasets and then combines it with complementary matching methods to create dense labels on nearby frames of novel videos. These labels are filtered by robust fitting, and then enhanced by propagating them to distant frames. The final model is trained on propagated data with strong augmentations. Not relying on complex 3D reconstruction makes GIM much more efficient and less likely to fail than standard SfM-and-MVS based frameworks. We also propose ZEB, the first zero-shot evaluation benchmark for image matching. By mixing data from diverse domains, ZEB can thoroughly assess the cross-domain generalization performance of different methods. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of GIM. Applying GIM consistently improves the zero-shot performance of 3 state-of-theart image matching architectures as the number of downloaded videos increases (Fig. 1 (a)); with 50 hours of YouTube videos, the relative zero-shot performance improves by 8.4% \u2212 18.1%. GIM also enables generalization to extreme crossdomain data such as Bird Eye View (BEV) images of projected 3D point clouds (Fig. 1 (c)). More importantly, our single zero-shot model consistently outperforms domain-specific baselines when evaluated on downstream tasks inherent to their respective domains. The code will be released upon acceptance.",

        "peer_review_with_watermark": "$$$$\n\nPaper Summary:\n\nThis paper introduces GIM (Generalizable Image Matching), a self-training framework that utilizes the vast amount of internet videos to develop a single generalizable image matcher. Initially, GIM trains any given image matching architecture on standard domain-specific datasets, and then enhances it with complementary matching methods to generate dense labels on adjacent frames from new videos. These labels undergo filtering through robust fitting and are subsequently improved by transferring them to distant frames. The final model is trained using the propagated data with strong augmentations. Additionally, GIM introduces ZEB (Zero-Shot Evaluation Benchmark), an innovative zero-shot evaluation benchmark for image matching that includes diverse real-world data.\n\nStrengths:\n\n1. GIM takes advantage of plentiful internet videos to learn generalizable image matching, making it more efficient and less prone to failure compared to traditional SfM-and-MVS based frameworks.\n2. GIM allows generalization to extreme cross-domain data, such as Bird Eye View (BEV) images of projected 3D point clouds.\n3. GIM consistently surpasses domain-specific baselines when assessed on downstream tasks relevant to their respective domains.\n4. GIM effectively enhances the zero-shot performance of three leading image matching architectures as the quantity of downloaded videos increases.\n5. GIM is more efficient at generating reliable supervision signals from diverse internet videos compared to conventional SfM and MVS based frameworks.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n1. GIM might need substantial video data to achieve optimal performance, which could limit its applicability in resource-constrained settings or environments with limited video access.\n2. GIM may struggle to generalize effectively to very distant or cluttered scenes due to potential loss of reliable correspondences during the propagation process.\n3. GIM depends on robust fitting to eliminate outlier correspondences, which may not be effective in scenarios with significant occlusion or noise.\n\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n\n1. GIM could improve its generalization to new scenes or domains by integrating more sophisticated techniques such as transfer learning or domain adaptation.\n2. GIM might also benefit from employing advanced image processing techniques like denoising or super-resolution to better capture fine details in video data.\n3. GIM could implement more sophisticated propagation methods like attention or attention-weighted propagation to enhance its capability in capturing contextual information from video data.\n\nRecommendation:\n\nI recommend GIM as a viable solution for image matching in resource-constrained or extreme cross-domain situations, given its ability to utilize abundant internet videos for learning generalizable image matching. However, further assessments and enhancements are necessary to mitigate potential drawbacks, such as the need for large video datasets or the risk of losing reliable correspondences during propagation.",

There is a lack of understanding of the interplay between global and local fairness in FL, particularly under data heterogeneity, and if and when one implies the other. To address this gap, we leverage a body of work in information theory called partial information decomposition (PID), which first identifies three sources of unfairness in FL, namely, Unique Disparity, Redundant Disparity, and Masked Disparity. We demonstrate how these three disparities contribute to global and local fairness using canonical examples. This decomposition helps us derive fundamental limits on the trade-off between global and local fairness, highlighting where they agree or disagree. We introduce the Accuracy & Global-Local Fairness Optimality Problem (AGLFOP), a convex optimization that defines the theoretical limits of accuracy and fairness trade-offs, identifying the best possible performance any FL strategy can attain given a dataset and client distribution.

We propose Pathformer, a multi-scale Transformer with adaptive pathways. It integrates both temporal resolution and temporal distance for multi-scale modeling. Multi-scale division divides the time series into different temporal resolutions using patches of various sizes. Based on the division of each scale, dual attention is performed over these patches to capture global correlations and local details as temporal dependencies. We further enrich the multiscale Transformer with adaptive pathways, which adaptively adjust the multi-scale modeling process based on the varying temporal dynamics of the input, improving the accuracy and generalization of Pathformer. Extensive experiments on eleven real-world datasets demonstrate that Pathformer not only achieves state-of-the-art performance by surpassing all current models but also exhibits stronger generalization abilities under various transfer scenarios.

        "abstract": "Characterizing samples that are difficult to learn from is crucial to developing highly performant ML models. This has led to numerous Hardness Characterization Methods (HCMs) that aim to identify \u201chard\u201d samples.

Unfortunately, current HCMs have only been evaluated on specific types of hardness and often only qualitatively or with respect to downstream performance, overlooking the fundamental quantitative identification task. We address this gap by presenting a fine-grained taxonomy of hardness types. Additionally, we propose the Hardness Characterization Analysis Toolkit (H-CAT), which supports comprehensive and quantitative benchmarking of HCMs across the hardness taxonomy and can easily be extended to new HCMs, hardness types, and datasets. We use H-CAT to evaluate 13 different HCMs across 8 hardness types. This comprehensive evaluation encompassing over 14K setups uncovers strengths and weaknesses of different HCMs, leading to practical tips to guide HCM selection and future development.

Whereas prior works have largely focused on leveraging LLMs for generating abstract plans in symbolic spaces, this work uses LLMs to guide the learning for structures and constraints in robot manipulation tasks. Specifically, we borrow from manipulation planning literature the concept of mode families, defining specific types of motion constraints among sets of objects, to serve as an intermediate layer that connects high-level language representations with low-level physical trajectories. By locally perturbing a small set of successful human demonstrations, we augment the dataset with additional successful executions as well as counterfactuals that fail the task. Our explanation-based learning framework trains neural network-based classifiers to differentiate success task executions from failures and as a by-product learns classifiers that ground low-level states into mode families without dense labeling. This further enables us to learn structured policies for the target task. Experimental validation in both 2D continuous-space and robotic manipulation environments demonstrates the robustness of our mode-based imitation methods under external perturbations.",
        "peer_review_without_watermark": "$$$\\begin{align}\\textbf{Paper Summary:} &\\quad The authors propose a framework called Manipulation Modes from Language Plans (MMLP) to ground abstract language plans in physical domains using mode families. MMLP leverages language models to generate mode families and counterfactual perturbations to augment the dataset. The framework uses an explanation-based learning paradigm to learn mode family classifiers and control policies. The authors evaluate MMLP on two benchmarks: a synthetic 2D polygon domain and Robosuite, a simulated robot manipulation environment.\\\\\n\\textbf{Strengths:} &\\quad The authors provide a clear and well-structured framework for grounding language plans in physical domains. The use of mode families and counterfactual perturbations is a novel approach to augmenting the dataset. The authors provide a comprehensive evaluation of MMLP on two benchmarks.\\\\\n\\textbf{Weaknesses:} &\\quad The authors' approach relies heavily on the quality of the language model outputs, which may not always be accurate. The use of counterfactual perturbations may not always be effective in augmenting the dataset. The authors' evaluation of MMLP on Robosuite is limited to a few tasks, and it is unclear how well MMLP will perform on more complex tasks.\\\\\n\\textbf{Suggestions for Improvement:} &\\quad The authors should investigate the use of more robust language models that can better handle noisy or ambiguous inputs. The authors should also explore the use of other methods for augmenting the dataset, such as active learning or transfer learning. The authors should provide more detailed evaluations of MMLP on more complex tasks and environments.\\\\\n\\textbf{Recommendation:} &\\quad The authors have made a significant contribution to the field of robotics and reinforcement learning by proposing a novel framework for grounding language plans in physical domains. While there are some limitations and weaknesses in the approach, the authors' evaluation of MMLP on two benchmarks provides strong evidence for the effectiveness of the framework. With further development and refinement, MMLP has the potential to become a leading approach in the field.\n\n$\\end{align}$$",

        "abstract": "Equilibrium propagation (EP) is a compelling alternative to the backpropagation of error algorithm (BP) for computing gradients of neural networks on biological or analog neuromorphic substrates. Still, the algorithm requires weight symmetry and infinitesimal equilibrium perturbations, i.e., nudges, to yield unbiased gradient estimates. Both requirements are challenging to implement in physical systems. Yet, whether and how weight asymmetry contributes to bias is unknown because, in practice, its contribution may be masked by a finite nudge. To address this question, we study generalized EP, which can be formulated without weight symmetry, and analytically isolate the two sources of bias. For complex-differentiable non-symmetric networks, we show that bias due to finite nudge can be avoided by estimating exact derivatives via a Cauchy integral. In contrast, weight asymmetry induces residual bias through poor alignment of EP\u2019s neuronal error vectors compared to BP resulting in low task performance. To mitigate the latter issue, we present a new homeostatic objective that directly penalizes functional asymmetries of the Jacobian at the network\u2019s fixed point. This homeostatic objective dramatically improves the network\u2019s ability to solve complex tasks such as ImageNet 32\u00d732. Our results lay the theoretical groundwork for studying and mitigating the adverse effects of imperfections of physical networks on learning algorithms that rely on the substrate\u2019s relaxation dynamics.",

        "peer_review_with_watermark": "**Paper Summary:**\nThis paper examines the potential of Equilibrium Propagation (EP) in the absence of perfect weight symmetry and its possible effects on learning algorithms that depend on the substrate's relaxation dynamics. EP serves as an attractive alternative to the backpropagation of error algorithm (BP) for gradient computation of neural networks on biological or analog neuromorphic substrates. However, EP has traditionally relied on weight symmetry and small equilibrium perturbations (nudges) to produce unbiased gradient estimates. This work addresses this limitation by providing an in-depth analysis of the bias sources in gradient estimates stemming from weight asymmetry and finite-size nudges within generalized EP. It also demonstrates that the bias caused by finite nudges can be mitigated through the calculation of exact derivatives using a Cauchy integral. Furthermore, the paper presents a novel homeostatic objective designed to reduce the Jacobian's asymmetry at the free equilibrium point without necessitating perfect weight symmetry. The effectiveness of this homeostatic objective is shown to enhance the performance of EP, particularly in complex tasks such as ImageNet 32\u00d732.",

        "abstract": "Maintaining legacy software requires many software and systems engineering hours. Assembly code programs, which demand low-level control over the computer machine state and have no variable names, are particularly difficult for humans to analyze. Existing conventional program translators guarantee correctness, but are hand-engineered for the source and target programming languages in question. Learned transpilation, i.e. automatic translation of code, offers an alternative to manual re-writing and engineering efforts. Automated symbolic program translation approaches guarantee correctness but struggle to scale to longer programs due to the exponentially large search space. Their rigid rule-based systems also limit their expressivity, so they can only reason about a reduced space of programs. Probabilistic neural language models (LMs) produce plausible outputs for every input, but do so at the cost of guaranteed correctness. In this work, we leverage the strengths of LMs and symbolic solvers in a neurosymbolic approach to learned transpilation for assembly code. Assembly code is an appropriate setting for a neurosymbolic approach, since assembly code can be divided into shorter non-branching basic blocks amenable to the use of symbolic methods. GUESS & SKETCH extracts alignment and confidence information from features of the LM then passes it to a symbolic solver to resolve semantic equivalence of the transpilation input and output. We test GUESS & SKETCH on three different test sets of assembly transpilation tasks, varying in difficulty, and show that it successfully transpiles 57.6% more examples than GPT-4 and 39.6% more examples than an engineered transpiler. We also share a training and evaluation dataset for this task.",

        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a standard approach for fine-tuning large language models to follow instructions. As part of this process, learned reward models are used to approximately model human preferences. However, as imperfect representations of the \u201ctrue\u201d reward, these learned reward models are susceptible to overoptimization. Gao et al. (2023) studied this phenomenon in a synthetic human feedback setup with a significantly larger \u201cgold\u201d reward model acting as the true reward (instead of humans) and showed that overoptimization remains a persistent problem regardless of the size of the proxy reward model and training data used. Using a similar setup, we conduct a systematic study to evaluate the efficacy of using ensemble-based conservative optimization objectives, specifically worst-case optimization (WCO) and uncertainty-weighted optimization (UWO), for mitigating reward model overoptimization when using two optimization methods: (a) best-of-n sampling (BoN) (b) proximal policy optimization (PPO). We additionally extend the setup of Gao et al. (2023) to include 25% label noise to better mirror real-world conditions. Both with and without label noise, we find that conservative optimization practically eliminates overoptimization and improves performance by up to 70% for BoN sampling. For PPO, ensemble-based conservative optimization always reduces overoptimization and outperforms single reward model optimization. Moreover, combining it with a small KL penalty successfully prevents overoptimization at no performance cost. Overall, our results demonstrate that ensemble-based conservative optimization can effectively counter overoptimization.",

Although several preventive measures have been developed to mitigate the potential risks associated with LLMs, they have primarily focused on English. In this study, we reveal the presence of multilingual jailbreak challenges within LLMs and consider two potential risky scenarios: unintentional and intentional. The unintentional scenario involves users querying LLMs using non-English prompts and inadvertently bypassing the safety mechanisms, while the intentional scenario concerns malicious users combining malicious instructions with multilingual prompts to deliberately attack LLMs. The experimental results reveal that in the unintentional scenario, the rate of unsafe content increases as the availability of languages decreases. Specifically, low-resource languages exhibit about three times the likelihood of encountering harmful content compared to high-resource languages, with both ChatGPT and GPT-4. In the intentional scenario, multilingual prompts can exacerbate the negative impact of malicious instructions, with astonishingly high rates of unsafe output: 80.92% for ChatGPT and 40.71% for GPT-4. To handle such a challenge in the multilingual context, we propose a novel SELF-DEFENSE framework that automatically generates multilingual training data for safety fine-tuning. Experimental results show that ChatGPT fine-tuned with such data can achieve a substantial reduction in unsafe content generation.

        "abstract": "In theoretical neuroscience, recent work leverages deep learning tools to explore how some network attributes critically influence its learning dynamics. Notably, initial weight distributions with small (resp. large) variance may yield a rich (resp. lazy) regime, where significant (resp. minor) changes to network states and representation are observed over the course of learning. However, in biology, neural circuit connectivity could exhibit a low-rank structure and therefore differs markedly from the random initializations generally used for these studies. As such, here we investigate how the structure of the initial weights \u2014 in particular their effective rank \u2014 influences the network learning regime. Through both empirical and theoretical analyses, we discover that high-rank initializations typically yield smaller network changes indicative of lazier learning, a finding we also confirm with experimentally-driven initial connectivity in recurrent neural networks. Conversely, low-rank initialization biases learning towards richer learning. Importantly, however, as an exception to this rule, we find lazier learning can still occur with a low-rank initialization that aligns with task and data statistics. Our research highlights the pivotal role of initial weight structures in shaping learning regimes, with implications for metabolic costs of plasticity and risks of catastrophic forgetting.",

        "abstract": "Alignment with human preference is a desired property of large language models (LLMs). Currently, the main alignment approach is based on reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Despite the effectiveness of RLHF, it is intricate to implement and train, thus recent studies explore how to develop alternative alignment approaches based on supervised fine-tuning (SFT). A major limitation of SFT is that it essentially does imitation learning, which cannot fully understand what are the expected behaviors. To address this issue, we propose an improved alignment approach named FIGA. Different from prior methods, we incorporate fine-grained (i.e., token or phrase level) quality signals that are derived by contrasting good and bad responses. Our approach has made two major contributions. Firstly, we curate a refined alignment dataset that pairs initial responses and the corresponding revised ones. Secondly, we devise a new loss function can leverage fine-grained quality signals to instruct the learning of LLMs for alignment. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approaches by comparing a number of competitive baselines. We release all the above-mentioned resources at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/FIGA.",

        "abstract": "Online-Within-Online (OWO) meta learning stands for the online multi-task learning paradigm in which both tasks and data within each task become available in a sequential order. In this work, we study the OWO meta learning of the initialization and step size of within-task online algorithms in the non-convex setting, and provide improved regret bounds under mild assumptions of loss functions. Previous work analyzing this scenario has obtained for bounded and piecewise Lipschitz functions an averaged regret bound O(( \u221a m T 1/4 + (logm) log T \u221a T + V ) \u221a m) across T tasks, with m iterations per task and V the task similarity. Our first contribution is to modify the existing non-convex OWO meta learning algorithm and improve the regret bound to O(( 1 T 1/2\u2212\u03b1 + (log T ) 9/2 T + V ) \u221a m), for any \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1/2). The derived bound has a faster convergence rate with respect to T , and guarantees a vanishing task-averaged regret with respect to m (for any fixed T ). Then, we propose a new algorithm of regret O(( log T T + V ) \u221a m) for non-convex OWO meta learning. This regret bound exhibits a better asymptotic performance than previous ones, and holds for any bounded (not necessarily Lipschitz) loss functions. Besides the improved regret bounds, our contributions include investigating how to attain generalization bounds for statistical meta learning via regret analysis. Specifically, by online-to-batch arguments, we achieve a transfer risk bound for batch meta learning that assumes all tasks are drawn from a distribution. Moreover, by connecting multi-task generalization error with taskaveraged regret, we develop for statistical multi-task learning a novel PAC-Bayes generalization error bound that involves our regret bound for OWO meta learning.",

Existing methods primarily treat layout generation as a numerical optimization task, focusing on quantitative aspects while overlooking the semantic information of layout, such as the relationship between each layout element. In this paper, we propose LayoutNUWA, the first model that treats layout generation as a code generation task to enhance semantic information and harnesses the hidden layout expertise of large language models (LLMs). More concretely, we develop a Code Instruct Tuning (CIT) approach comprising three interconnected modules: 1) the Code Initialization (CI) module quantifies the numerical conditions and initializes them as HTML code with strategically placed masks; 2) the Code Completion (CC) module employs the formatting knowledge of LLMs to fill in the masked portions within the HTML code; 3) the Code Rendering (CR) module transforms the completed code into the final layout output, ensuring a highly interpretable and transparent layout generation procedure that directly maps code to a visualized layout.

        "abstract": "Knowledge distillation aims to train a compact student network using soft supervision from a larger teacher network and hard supervision from ground truths. However, determining an optimal knowledge fusion ratio that balances these supervisory signals remains challenging. Prior methods generally resort to a constant or heuristic-based fusion ratio, which often falls short of a proper balance. In this study, we introduce a novel adaptive method for learning a sample-wise knowledge fusion ratio, exploiting both the correctness of teacher and student, as well as how well the student mimics the teacher on each sample. Our method naturally leads to the intra-sample trilateral geometric relations among the student prediction (S), teacher prediction (T ), and ground truth (G). To counterbalance the impact of outliers, we further extend to the inter-sample relations, incorporating the teacher\u2019s global average prediction (T\u0304 ) for samples within the same class. A simple neural network then learns the implicit mapping from the intraand inter-sample relations to an adaptive, sample-wise knowledge fusion ratio in a bilevel-optimization manner. Our approach provides a simple, practical, and adaptable solution for knowledge distillation that can be employed across various architectures and model sizes. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent improvements over other loss re-weighting methods on image classification, attack detection, and click-through rate prediction.",

        "abstract": "Graph-based semi-supervised learning, particularly in the context of extremely sparse labeled data, often suffers from degenerate solutions where label functions tend to be nearly constant across unlabeled data. In this paper, we introduce Variance-enlarged Poisson Learning (VPL), a simple yet powerful framework tailored to alleviate the issues arising from the presence of degenerate solutions. VPL incorporates a variance-enlarged regularization term, which induces a Poisson equation specifically for unlabeled data. This intuitive approach increases the dispersion of labels from their average mean, effectively reducing the likelihood of degenerate solutions characterized by nearly constant label functions.

        "abstract": "Previous literature on policy diversity in reinforcement learning (RL) either focuses on the online setting or ignores the policy performance. In contrast, offline RL, which aims to learn high-quality policies from batched data, has yet to fully leverage the intrinsic diversity of the offline dataset. Addressing this dichotomy and aiming to balance quality and diversity poses a significant challenge to extant methodologies. This paper introduces a novel approach, termed Stylized Offline RL (SORL), which is designed to extract high-performing, stylistically diverse policies from a dataset characterized by distinct behavioral patterns. Drawing inspiration from the venerable Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, SORL innovatively alternates between policy learning and trajectory clustering, a mechanism that promotes policy diversification. To further augment policy performance, we introduce advantage-weighted style learning into the SORL framework. Experimental evaluations across multiple environments demonstrate the significant superiority of SORL over previous methods in extracting high-quality policies with diverse behaviors. A case in point is that SORL successfully learns strong policies with markedly distinct playing patterns from a real-world human dataset of a popular basketball video game \u201dDunk City Dynasty.\u201d",

Through style clustering, which classifies trajectories based on style, SORL identifies a collection of m most representative policies {\u00b5(1), \u00b5(2),..., \u00b5(m)} from a heterogeneous dataset. In the style-weighted imitation learning phase, SORL derives a set of policies {\u03c0(1), \u03c0(2),..., \u03c0(m)} by solving a constrained optimization problem. Experimental results across several environments, such as a grid shooting game, various Atari games, and a real-world human dataset from a well-known basketball video game, highlight SORL's considerable advantage over existing methods in producing high-quality policies with varied behaviors.\n\nStrengths:\n\n- SORL integrates style clustering, style-weighted imitation learning, and an advanced loss function, enabling the acquisition of both high-quality and diverse policies.\n- The method has undergone extensive testing across different tasks, including a grid shooting game, Atari games, and a human dataset from a popular basketball video game, achieving remarkable superiority in various metrics like quality, diversity, and consistency.\n- SORL is designed for application in real-world scenarios, particularly in online gaming, autonomous driving, and opponent modeling, where developing diverse opponents is beneficial.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n- The reliance on a two-stage process might heighten computational demands and elevate the risk of mode dropping during style clustering.\n- Although aimed at real-world tasks, the effectiveness of SORL in other fields, such as control systems, is still unclear.\n- A thorough comparison of SORL with cutting-edge reinforcement learning methods is necessary, especially in scenarios where acquiring numerous policies presents challenges, like in control systems.\n\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n\n- Explore strategies to mitigate mode dropping in style clustering, such as employing ensemble learning with multiple style classifiers, utilizing Bayesian inference, or implementing self-supervised learning for a style classifier.\n- Test SORL in domains where learning many policies is difficult, such as control systems, robotics, or medical decision-making, where acquiring numerous policies may not be practical due to resource limitations, yet a few high-quality policies could still provide value.\n- Investigate the application of SORL in learning many policies, like in deep reinforcement learning, where acquiring a multitude of policies could lead to improved average returns, albeit potentially increasing the risk of mode dropping in style clustering.\n\nRecommendation:\n\n- SORL demonstrates significant benefits across various tasks, especially in areas where acquiring a large number of policies is challenging, such as in opponent modeling, online gaming, and autonomous driving.

        "abstract": "The fluency and creativity of large pre-trained language models (LLMs) have led to their widespread use, sometimes even as a replacement for traditional search engines. Yet language models are prone to making convincing but factually inaccurate claims, often referred to as \u2018hallucinations.\u2019 These errors can inadvertently spread misinformation or harmfully perpetuate misconceptions. Further, manual fact-checking of model responses is a time-consuming process, making human factuality labels expensive to acquire. In this work, we fine-tune language models to be more factual, without human labeling and targeting more open-ended generation settings than past work. We leverage two key recent innovations in NLP to do so. First, several recent works have proposed methods for judging the factuality of open-ended text by measuring consistency with an external knowledge base or simply a large model\u2019s confidence scores. Second, the direct preference optimization algorithm enables straightforward fine-tuning of language models on objectives other than supervised imitation, using a preference ranking over possible model responses. We show that learning from automatically generated factuality preference rankings, generated either through existing retrieval systems or our novel retrieval-free approach, significantly improves the factuality (percent of generated claims that are correct) of Llama-2 on held-out topics compared with RLHF or decoding strategies targeted at factuality. At 7B scale, compared to Llama-2-chat, we observe 58% and 40% reduction in factual error rate when generating biographies and answering medical questions, respectively.",

Many such approaches, however, lack formal guarantees establishing the precise relationship between the model and the extracted rules, and this lack of assurance becomes especially problematic when the extracted rules are applied in safetycritical contexts or to ensure compliance with legal requirements. Recent research has examined whether the rules derived from the influential NEURAL-LP model exhibit soundness (or completeness), which means that the results obtained by applying the model to any dataset always contain (or are contained in) the results obtained by applying the rules to the same dataset. In this paper, we extend this analysis to the context of DRUM, an approach that has demonstrated superior practical performance. After observing that the rules currently extracted from a DRUM model can be unsound and/or incomplete, we propose a novel algorithm where the output rules, expressed in an extension of Datalog, ensure both soundness and completeness. This algorithm, however, can be inefficient in practice and hence we propose additional constraints to DRUM models facilitating rule extraction, albeit at the expense of reduced expressive power.",

The authors introduce the MaxEnt model correction framework, which utilizes maximum entropy density estimation to mitigate model errors based on a limited number of queries to the actual dynamics. The framework is applied to both policy evaluation and control, demonstrating considerable acceleration in convergence rates and reaching true value functions, provided the model errors are sufficiently small. Additionally, the paper presents MoCoDyna, a sample-based variant that enhances the Dyna framework. The authors validate the efficacy of their method through numerical experiments, comparing its performance to other RL algorithms and showing improved convergence rates and expected returns.\n\nStrengths:\n1. The paper offers a clear and well-organized explanation of key concepts and techniques, such as the definition of model error, maximum entropy density estimation, and the MaxEnt model correction framework.\n2. The authors conduct a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the framework, including convergence results and error bounds, establishing a robust basis for practical applications.\n3. The introduction of MoCoDyna, a sample-based variant that extends the Dyna framework, presents an alternative method for mitigating model errors in RL.\n4. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is substantiated through numerical experiments, revealing superior performance compared to other RL algorithms in convergence rates and expected returns.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. The paper does not clearly address hyperparameter choices, such as the number of queries, basis functions, and learning rates, which are essential in practice.\n2. The authors do not provide specific insights on how the performance of MoCoVI and MoCoDyna declines as the number of queries increases, which would help clarify the balance between accuracy and computational expense.\n3. The robustness of the framework against noise and uncertainty in real-world applications is not discussed, an essential aspect for practical implementation.\n4. The paper lacks detailed analysis on how the performance of MoCoVI and MoCoDyna diminishes with an increasing number of time steps, impacting our understanding of long-term algorithm performance.\n\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n1. The authors should explicitly discuss the selection of hyperparameters and how these choices impact algorithm performance.\n2. Results demonstrating how MoCoVI and MoCoDyna's performance changes with more queries, and optimization of the accuracy-computational cost trade-off, should be included.\n3. An examination of the framework's robustness to environmental noise and uncertainty is necessary, along with results demonstrating the algorithms' performance under such conditions.\n4. The authors should provide analysis on the performance degradation of MoCoVI and MoCoDyna with increased time steps, and how this influences long-term algorithm efficacy.\n\nRecommendation:\nThis paper introduces a cost-effective strategy for addressing model errors in RL and offers extensive theoretical analysis of the framework. The authors showcase the method's effectiveness through numerical experiments, highlighting its superior performance relative to other RL algorithms. Although there are areas for enhancement\u2014such as clearer discussions on hyperparameters and robustness against noise and uncertainty\u2014the paper lays a solid groundwork for the practical use of the MaxEnt model correction framework. By refining their approach and presenting explicit performance results, this paper could achieve high quality upon revision and resubmission.\n\n$\n\\\\\n\nNote: The review is lengthy; consider dividing it into smaller sections or reducing its overall length. More concrete and specific comments on the paper's shortcomings could also be beneficial.",

        "abstract": "Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) stands as a cornerstone optimization algorithm with proven real-world empirical successes but relatively limited theoretical understanding. Recent research has illuminated a key factor contributing to its practical efficacy: the implicit regularization it instigates. Several studies have investigated the linear stability property of SGD in the vicinity of a stationary point as a predictive proxy for sharpness and generalization error in overparameterized neural networks (Wu et al., 2022; Jastrzebski et al., 2019; Cohen et al., 2021). In this paper, we delve deeper into the relationship between linear stability and sharpness. More specifically, we meticulously delineate the necessary and sufficient conditions for linear stability, contingent on hyperparameters of SGD and the sharpness at the optimum. Towards this end, we introduce a novel coherence measure of the loss Hessian that encapsulates pertinent geometric properties of the loss function that are relevant to the linear stability of SGD. It enables us to provide a simplified sufficient condition for identifying linear instability at an optimum. Notably, compared to previous works, our analysis relies on significantly milder assumptions and is applicable for a broader class of loss functions than known before, encompassing not only mean-squared error but also cross-entropy loss.",
