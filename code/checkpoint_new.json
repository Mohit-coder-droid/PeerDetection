        "title": "REWARD-FREE CURRICULA FOR TRAINING ROBUST WORLD MODELS",
        "abstract": "There has been a recent surge of interest in developing generally-capable agents that can adapt to new tasks without additional training in the environment. Learning world models from reward-free exploration is a promising approach, and enables policies to be trained using imagined experience for new tasks. However, achieving a general agent requires robustness across different environments. In this work, we address the novel problem of generating curricula in the reward-free setting to train robust world models. We consider robustness in terms of minimax regret over all environment instantiations and show that the minimax regret can be connected to minimising the maximum error in the world model across environment instances. This result informs our algorithm, WAKER: Weighted Acquisition of Knowledge across Environments for Robustness. WAKER selects environments for data collection based on the estimated error of the world model for each environment. Our experiments demonstrate that WAKER outperforms several baselines, resulting in improved robustness, efficiency, and generalisation.",

Shah et al.***\n===========================================================\n\nIntroduction:\nThe study by Shah et al. explores the self-regulation of emotions and cognitive performance under stress and relaxation. The researchers examine the relationships between emotional regulation and cognitive processes under different emotional states. The study contributes to our understanding of the complex interplay between emotions and cognition.\n\nMethodology:\nThe study employed an experiment-based approach, where participants completed an emotional regulation task while experiencing either stress or relaxation. The task consisted of identifying emotions from facial expressions and rating their intensity. The researchers used an emotional regulation strategy training program to enhance participants' ability to self-regulate their emotions. The sample consisted of 120 participants, who were randomly assigned to either the stress or relaxation condition. The study found significant differences between the two conditions, indicating that emotional regulation strategies were more beneficial under stress than relaxation.\n\nCritique:\nThe study has several strengths, including the innovative emotional regulation strategy training program and the well-controlled experiment design. However, there are some limitations and areas for improvement:\n\n1.  **Small sample size:** The study's sample size of 120 participants is relatively small, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Future studies could benefit from larger samples to increase the statistical power and reliability of the results.\n\n2.  **Limited emotional regulation strategies:** The study employed only two emotional regulation strategies, which may not capture the complexity of human emotional regulation. Future studies could explore additional strategies and their effects on cognitive performance.\n\n3.  **Stress and relaxation manipulations:** The study's stress and relaxation manipulations were based on self-reported measures of stress and relaxation. While these measures can provide valuable insights, they may not be as objective as other methods, such as physiological measures. Future studies could consider incorporating additional measures to validate the manipulations.\n\n4.  **Cognitive performance measures:** The study used rating scales to measure cognitive performance. While rating scales can be useful, they may not provide as detailed or nuanced information as other measures, such as performance on specific cognitive tasks. Future studies could consider incorporating additional measures to provide more comprehensive insights into cognitive performance.\n\nConclusion:\nThe study by Shah et al. provides valuable insights into the self-regulation of emotions and cognitive performance under stress and relaxation. While there are some limitations, the study's findings have significant implications for our understanding of the complex interplay between emotions and cognition. Future studies could build on the current study by exploring additional emotional regulation strategies, incorporating additional measures of stress and relaxation, and examining the effects of emotional regulation on cognitive performance under different contexts.\n\nRecommendations:\n\n*   **Future studies:** Consider incorporating additional emotional regulation strategies and measures of stress and relaxation to increase the complexity and validity of the findings.\n*   **Cognitive performance measures:** Incorporate additional measures of cognitive performance to provide more comprehensive insights into the effects of emotional regulation on cognitive performance.\n\nOverall, the study by Shah et al. contributes to our understanding of the complex interplay between emotions and cognition. While there are some limitations, the study's findings have significant implications for our understanding of the self-regulation of emotions and cognitive performance under stress and relaxation.",
